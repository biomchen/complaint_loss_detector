I even sent them a screenshot of it showing no need for the XRP tag when I pulled up the deposit form on their site. They proceed to tell me they can not put the currency that I transfered to their wallet in my XRP wallet when this was NOT my fault in ANY WAY!!! This is a fault with their site and DEV team letting people submit transfers without their system being fully operational and in no way did it say any tag requirement when I made the transfer and I have proof of that.

I can not do this as Wells Fargo only offers options of ( 1 ) using XXXX to send money or ( 2 ) wire money or ( 3 ) send a paper check by defining the recipient as a payee. 
Option 1 ( XXXX ) does not work as I have my email associated with another account ( XXXX ). 
Option 2 ( wire ) costs {$30.00} Option 3 is inconvenient and outdated. I don't want to get a check as TD does not have branches and I won't be able to deposit is. I also want to keep all transactions digital. 

By designing the system to only transfer money using XXXX, it does 2 things : 1 - limits the amount to {$2500.00} which is not sufficient for many purposes 2- making it practically impossible to transfer money to other individuals ( e.g., family members ) or self at other banks. 

My money is now practically trapped at Wells Fargo, and it must be very convenient for them as they are making interest on my deposit and also limit their fraud risk by basically making it impossible to take money out of account, instead of building an up-to-date fraud prevention system. 

I'd like to see big banks forced to bring back the old ACH transfer system.

19848,2019-03-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I went to pay my house payment last month and found that Mr Cooper/ Nationstar raised my house payment over {$600.00} per month. Loan # XXXX I immediately call Mr cooper to find out what was going on. I was told that my taxes went up and there was not enough money in the escrow account to pay the taxes. 
I knew this was not true as I just filed my taxes and my taxes had only gone up by around {$160.00} per year total. 
I told them that and they argued with me and declined to get me to someone that I could talk to about this. 
After looking into this more, what I found is that when Mr cooper put my loan together they did not include one of the tax lots that my property is on. 
I know that they knew about the extra tax lot because they were trying to get a better loan to value on the property by using the lot in the appraisal but couldn't. 
They also had several years of my tax records before they would process the loan. 
Here is what I know happened. I only was getting the load to pay off some credit card dept that I occurred to remodel the property. I told the loan  officer XXXX XXXX that I did not want my payments to be higher than what I was paying at the time. 
She assured me that they would only be a few dollars more than what I was paying at the time. 
Also after they told me the loan was approved and there would be enough money to pay off what I wanted to they came back to me and said that they had to raise the interest rate so that the loan would qualify. 
That did not set well with me but I did it because the rate although higher than I had been quoted by other companies was not much higher and I did not want to go through the whole process again with another company. 
Bottom line is that I just can not afford to pay an extra {$600.00} plus a month on my house payment. This because Mr Cooper did not do there job when putting the loan together.

He found the guy in a private XXXX group for XXXX owners. The guy eventually called me to arrange for the sale. Because I assumed my brother had already vetted the guy, I was more comfortable making the transaction, but was still a little hesitant. I should have trusted my gut feeling. I proposed completing the transaction via XXXX because they are more secure, but the alleged seller suggested XXXX or XXXX. Since my bank, Chase Bank, offered XXXX and promoted it as an option for sending money, I assumed my bank provided the same protections as they did for fraudulent transactions from my checking, savings, debit card and credit card accounts. Because I was still a little hesitant, I offered to send half the money upfront and the other half once I received verifiable proof the top was shipped. The alleged seller agreed. Shortly after sending the alleged seller {$420.00} and confirming it was sent, I went back to the sellers listings and inquired about some other parts. This communication was via XXXX messenger as I originally communicated with the alleged seller by phone since my brother gave him my number. It was during the messenger exchange that it was discovered the top did not belong to the alleged seller and was not shipped as promised. I immediately contacted my bank to stop or recover the XXXX transaction. While on the on the phone with my bank, the seller texted me a tracking number and requested the final payment of {$420.00}. He began to call and text a few times while on the phone with my bank, but I ignored the attempts. After filing my fraud complaint and completing the call with my bank, I texted the scammer back and requested an invoice. He deflected and said there was no need to send an invoice because it was already shipped, and again requested the remaining {$420.00} of the {$850.00} sale price be sent to complete the sale. I then informed him that I knew he was a scammer, which he obviously denied. During that exchange he agreed to send me back the {$420.00}, but I knew that was never going to happen. This all happened within a 20 to 30 minute timeframe. While filing my claim with my bank I asked several questions, which revealed that even though I was a victim of fraud/scam, I would be provided no protections because I authorized the transaction. That is puzzling because I was still a victim of fraud despite the bank 's interpretation and what constituted their protections for me as a customer. I assumed that if my bank promoted services with XXXX, that I would be afforded protections against fraud. It was clear during the process of me filing the fraud complaint that me getting my {$420.00} back was more than likely not going to be the outcome. I am a victim of fraud and I feel like the bank should refund my money since the XXXX service they provided offers no options for getting the money back from the scammers no matter how soon you report the fraud. The bank should not offer the service if there are no remedies for fraud and offer no protections. I should be refunded {$420.00} and the bank should stop offering XXXX services if they can not provide protections to its customers or sufficient remedies for recovery. I have to wait 10 days while they investigate my fraud claim that they have already disclosed the likelihood of recovering my money is very, very low. XXXX also offered no resolution and kept me on hold for XXXX hours before I eventually hung up. XXXX made no attempt to collect any information from my fraud claim and said I should contact my bank, which I did before contacting them. 

The information the scammer used is below : Name used :. XXXX XXXX Email address used : XXXX Phone number used :. ( XXXX ) XXXX Also note : the email was verified by XXXX on the Chase website. One would assume that verification by Chase and XXXX meant the address was good and free from fraud, but that is the false security Chase and XXXX provides its customers.

XXXX after no return call from XXXX, my husband and I drove to the bank to speak with XXXX. We were told she was in a meeting. We speak with XXXX XXXX and she said she would call by the end of the day. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX called to tell us there was nothing that could be done to reverse this. She transferred me to XXXX then XXXX went into XXXX 's office so all 3 of us could talk. XXXX told me she contacted the debit card department and was told that once a new card is issued, the old card is marked as inactive but we can still use it for 30 days but after that we HAD to use the new one! I can't even wrap my head around this. I would think this is an illegal activity, I told her I would like the name of the Supervisor that is over the girl that cancelled our card. I also asked for more information so I could file this complaint, dates/times of communications to internal departments. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  As of today I have not heard back from XXXX XXXX, branch manager of the XXXX Commerce Bank, or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

We NEVER authorized the cancellation of our current debit card in order to be changed to a Platinum debit card. 

Our current debit card goes completely inactive on the XXXX of XXXX per XXXX.

The last call to XXXX in Texas in the fraud department resulted in a 2 hour hold, which is when restrictions started being placed on the accounts. I then went on to discuss the matter with Client Protection Service. They said the accounts would be closed pending further review due to an altered check. 

XX/XX/2022 This is the day I was told by XXXX the accounts would be closed, and if there were any remaining funds ( there is ) they would be mailed out via cashiers check to the address on file. There were still ACH transactions attempting to process in the account, so the closure was pushed until XX/XX/2022 XX/XX/2022 I called XXXX to follow up and inquire about XXXX tracking numbers they claimed I would receive at that time. Instead, I was told all funds were sent to back office for further review due to a stolen check. No funds being released at this time. The check is not stolen, so that in itself is false, and I am most certainly not a thief but XXXX in Client Protection Services seems to think so since she claims that I have stolen this check. No one else has said anything about the check but her. Everyone else was unwilling to disclose, which I understand is not something the bank is obliged ( disclose ) to do. 

At this time, I am believed to have been committed a crime, whereas here in the United States of America you are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. I have all necessary legal documentation that backs the authorization and disbursement of this check ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). It is registered in XXXX XXXX in the state of New York. 

The clearing house had more than enough time to verify the authenticity of this check. Thats not the case. 
If the check was indeed reported stolen, this process that Bank of America is putting me through would not be going the way it is. I would have law enforcement officers knocking on my door. The bank would have closed the account immediately and ceased communications with me. Theft is not the case. 
The check is not reported stolen. There are 5 other members in this estate who have all received their funds and started spending them already. Granted, none of the other legatees in this estate are clients of Bank of America. Only me. 

There is something that someone in one of these departments is not telling me or being upfront about, and while the banks policy states you are under no obligation to disclose the immediate reason, there is clearly an error on someones behalf, and it is not mine nor the checkwriters.

I tried to make payments in XX/XX/XXXX, via the online portal and by phone. I was unable because my online portal is blocked. I called on two occasions and could not get anyone on the phone and on one occasion was informed that your system was down. They have locked me out from making payments online, you refuse to take an EFT payment, they refuse to auto deduct my payment, and have refused to post a cashiers check payment sent to them. You have eliminated every option that I have to pay my mortgage. This is unlawful, unnecessarily burdensome, and causes additional expense, stress, and duress. 

I spoke to a member of their team on XX/XX/XXXX in the morning that told me that I could send a cashiers check for {$3900.00} ( 2 of the 3 past due payments ) which I did. I sent a cashiers check, # XXXX, USPS, overnight certified mail exactly as I was instructed.

What Ive been able to determine is that they would not accept this check either and that I needed to send other cashier 's check for {$8100.00} XXXXthe total past due ) today to bring my account current. No one at Union Home Mortgage is able to tell me when and if this guaranteed funds cashier 's check will be returned to me. The new demand from Union Home Mortgage requires a total out of pocket from me of {$12000.00} even though my entire past due balance is {$8100.00} which is unlawful, unnecessarily burdensome, and causes additional expense, stress, and duress. 

The terms of my current forbearance agreement require them to accept partial funds. There is no reason even outside the forbearance agreement for them to not accept two full monthly payments ( 2 of 3 that are past due and the 3rd past due is them not permitting me to make a payment ) in the form of a cashiers check drawn on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You can not tell me when or even if the cashiers check will be returned to me so that I can use these funds for the lions share of what is past due, but you are unwilling to post the payment to my account. The only incentive for them to not accept this payment is additional fees and costs and is unlawful, unnecessarily burdensome, and causes additional expense on my end. 

I was informed today that my account will require cashiers checks moving forward into XXXX for you to accept my timely not past due payments. No provision in my mortgage gives you them the ability to make this demand with or without notice. I was told today that a letter was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX that I did not receive. I have a 1-inch-thick package of documents received from Union Home Mortgage and it is not in this information. I need to see what notice could have been sent that would give them the authority to alter the original mortgage contract without my consent. I was told today that I could review this notice online, but I can not access any documentation having been locked out of my portal.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Union Home Mortgage Corp,TX,77373,,Consent provided,Web,2022-08-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5889966

19939,2022-05-24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"JP Morgan Chase My bank account was hacked in the early morning of XX/XX/XXXX, my personal information was changed, including email, phone number, and mailing address to an out of state address. Money from my checking account was transferred to XXXX XXXX and my debit card was registered to XXXX for a ride, for a total of {$160.00} in fraudulent transactions. A credit card through Chase was also opened in my name online that day. The {$160.00} has yet to be returned to me as this check was mailed by Chase to a fraudulent address that Chase assured me had been removed from my account and the check was then fraudulently endorsed and cashed. 

background information : I went into Chase that morning of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM to freeze and close my checking account out and to cancel the credit card that was opened. Chase originally failed to close out my account in person, even though I was told it was being closed out, and I had to go back two more times to get them to successfully close the account out. I was assured the second time going into a branch location that my information was successfully updated back to my personal information as I waited for Chase to mail a cashier 's check for my full account amount plus the fraudulent activity of {$160.00}. However, as my mother had a linked account with me at the time she could still see the wrong address showing on my account ( and that the account was not successfully closed out like it was supposed to be ), so the third time I went back into the Chase branch I requested they cut me a cashier 's check for the non-fraudulent amount remaining in my account that day for fear they would send all of my money to this fraudulent address. 

As for the {$160.00} of fraudulent charges that Chase had to process through their fraud department I was told this would then have to come as a mailed check due to my account officially being closed out, which I was fine with and was assured through the branch and speaking over the phone with multiple departments would be sent to my current correct original address on file ( Chase told me it would take about 3 weeks to process a fraud claim from XX/XX/XXXX and then mail a check out ). 

However, after waiting two months I continued to call for updates and was eventually notified that the check was already cashed ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), it was mailed to the fraudulent address from XX/XX/XXXX, and signed and endorsed in my name to a XXXX XXXX XXXX, even after being told by numerous departments at Chase the address issue was resolved. I have yet to receive these funds at this point and Chase sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" the bank that accepted your check is responsible for repayment. We have initiated a claim on your behalf to attempt to recover your lost funds ''. I have yet to hear anything back about this claim. 

Chase failed through multiple departments to correct my address on file that was originally changed online through a hack. I have updated my police report to report that Chase has failed to return these funds as well - the {$160.00}. 

I would also like to note that I received a letter from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the I was not responsible for the credit card opened in my name and that they would work with the consumer reporting agency to have this removed from my consumer report but as of XX/XX/XXXX the inquiry is still on file with XXXX. 

I then also received another notice XX/XX/XXXX stating another credit card was attempted to be opened in my name, a business visa signature card, through Chase again. All fraudulent activity occurring under my SSN are all happening through Chase. 

There are multiple issues listed above regarding how JP Morgan Chase has handled these events. I have spent countless hours on the phone with different Chase departments, all calls that are stated to be recorded, yet problems continue to be left unresolved.

I only have XXXX credit card and I need to use it tomorrow when I go to work to pay for parking. I have no idea what to do about this issue. The company should be able to call me directly and speak with me in regards to the purchases that were made. I should not have to take off work just to go to the company to discuss this. XXXX  should be able to deal with this issue directly. There should be customer service representative from either the company or XXXX  who can deal with this matter with me over the phone or after hours. I am 99 % sure that it has to do with the ATM going down and the purchases I made- not some fraudulent charges on my card. The company is not handling this situation well at all. I am ready to cancel my card due to the outrageous customer service I am receiving over something that is so trivial. I would like to hear back from XXXX  as well as my company in regards to this matter. There has to be a better way in our day and age to do business and to keep customers. I do not nor will I go online and deal with my transactions in regards to the credit card. I don't need someone hacking my account.

Caliber is extending my mortgage by 14 years, or nearly {$170000.00}. more in payments, because they will not receive the money ( {$25000.00} ) from the state of AZ for approximately 3 weeks, yet advised they still plan to keep the money from the state of AZ upon receipt. 

I am forced to sign the modification documents that they actually mailed to an incorrect address, and so had to e-Mail to me shortening the amount of time I had to review. I am told I must sign these papers, and increase my mortgage payments to Caliber by 14 years, from the 26 year balance to a new 40 year loan they never discussed with me or advised me of, even though I am now aware of a potentially fraudulent act on the part of my mortgage servicer. 

The {$25000.00} that I applied for assistance to the state for was to be used to make up for the payments not made during the forbearance period. I did not intend for the state to send that money to Caliber to have them collect it in addition to collecting 14 more years of payments from me. They are doing this with full knowledge that they are being paid twice. As they told me about this, I feel they have now made me a party to their unjust enrichment/fraudulent acts. 

The paperwork that they provided me with states that the unpaid amount of mortgage payments was approximately {$20000.00}. They advised State Of Arizona That the outstanding amount due is in excess of XXXX. They have also quoted other outstanding amounts in the area of {$26000.00}. Each time I speak with them there is a different dollar amount quoted, which is very disconcerting.

I have not been able to access my account online at Caliber bank website for nearly 2 years. They have limited access to anyone who is part of the Forbearance program. I switched to electronic access to my account just before the forbearance program/Covid struck. As such I am flying blind in this regard and can not obtain an accurate assessment of my account. I was told to send three trial payments in to Caliber bank beginning in XXXX and I have done so. I made the first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I sent those by mail as instructed. I have made five mortgage payments, in full, with the last being made online through my bank on XXXX XXXX. 

I cant be a party to Caliber Banks plan to keep the money, but Caliber Bank has only given me until XX/XX/XXXX to mail the modification documents back to them, or are threatening foreclosure. This was per my conversation with XXXX at Caliber bank today. 

Yesterday, I spoke with a XXXX at Caliber Bank who asked me to provide her with proof that the state of AZ/HAF is/will be making the payments and approved my application for assistance. I emailed her a PDF version of the approval letter from HAF as well as a PDF print out of the XXXX1 payments being made in the amount of {$2000.00}, and one payment in the amount of {$2000.00}. The total of this is {$25000.00} being paid to Caliber bank. Regardless, I was told today that they are accepting those payments but still modifying my mortgage as if the payments are not being received. They told me I have to EITHER accept the payment from the state OR accept the modification but not both. I confirm that if I accept the payment from the state, which wont be a receipt for three weeks, they will likely put my account into foreclosure status so thats not an option. The payment from the state is not going to me its going to Caliber bank anyway. Accepting one or the other which is not even possible in my case. Yet, they are doing BOTH, taking the payment from the state of Arizona and taking 14 additional years of payments from me.

They are well aware of this yet are continuing to tell me that these are my options. I have no options. Theyre forcing me to sign the modification knowing that they intend to take the states money and keep it even though its not legal for them to do so. 
This is not only reimbursement from two different individuals/entities for the same loss but the bank is knowingly involving me in this, when I applied for assistance from the state, but never to assist Caliber in committing fraud.
I dont have any good option in this case, as Caliber is forcing my hand. 

When I repeated this back to XXXX today at Caliber Bank and asked her if this is truly what they expect of me and intend to do, she said basically yes, the only other option is my account will go into foreclosure status, I was appalled.

2. This Unemployment forbearance was to end in XX/XX/XXXX. That fall I was required to reapply for the annual XXXX XXXX payment recalculation which was completed timely and correctly.

I contacted Nationstar now Mr. Cooper and asked that this be corrected and that my mortgage be reported to the 3 reporting agencies and was told that this would be taken care of. Well it is now XXXX of XXXX and nothing, In XXXX I again called Nationstar which was now Mr. Cooper and tried to get this taken care of and was told that the credit reporting agencies were the ones requesting that it not be reported, and that I needed to send a letter to Mr. Cooper requesting that my payments were once again reported, which I did in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. After thinking about this I contacted all 3 of the agencies to see why they had requested my mortgage not be reported and was informed that it was Nationstar that asked that the reporting cease. When I discovered this I again called Mr. Cooper, this time I was informed that it was the equity accelerator program that had made the request. I finally got to speak with a supervisor, XXXX who was very kind and said that she would look into the matter and try to get to the bottom of it and gave me a date of XX/XX/XXXX. I then received a letter from Mr. Cooper asking me to send them a letter requesting that they begin reporting my mortgage. I once again contacted XXXX. She tried once again to be helpful and told me that the original letter I sent in on XX/XX/XXXX was on file and did not understand why this letter was being asked for again. XXXX told me that she was going to get to the bottom of this and was also going to attempt to have the matter expedited. We are now coming up on the end of XXXX and still this matter, despite my letter and numerous requests is still in the same situation it was when I asked it be corrected last XXXX. I do not understand what it is going to take to resolve this matter, and therefore am looking to you for help. I have worked hard improving my credit and I know that having never missed or been late on a mortgage payment if my mortgage was being reported as it should my score would increase dramatically. I want nothing more than to get away from Mr. Cooper, but until they start reporting to the credit bureaus I'm stuck.

Now Im struggling to make payments because I have to make repairs to my home due to it not being completely renovated. For example my pipes burst due to the Polar Vortex in XXXX which cost me a lot to repair. The pipes froze because I dont have any walls up in my first unit. I had about 13 or more busted pipes. I called Loan Depot on XX/XX/XXXX to see what options I had. I was told I could extend my forebearance and they sent me a modification package which I have not received. Today XX/XX/XXXX I called to extend the forebearance and i was told I couldnt. I cant believe I was lied to. I am so upset that Im struggling due to their negligence and they wont help me. I also begged Loan Depot last year to close my fha case so I could refinance they said they would and did not do so. I am paying way more in interest than I should be and cant even refinance to save money to finish this renovation. I cant get help from other banks because my building is not completed.

We endured a hardship beginning in XX/XX/XXXX and started the loan modification process with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We completed all of our paperwork and submitted it to XXXX   XXXX XXXX. During the review process, we received a letter from XXXX   XXXX XXXX stating our new servicer would be Ditech Financial, LLC effective XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the modification status and was told that our modification was going to be handed by Ditech. I followed up with Ditech between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX regarding the loan modification. During this time, I kept being told our application/documents were either old or incomplete. I submitted paperwork 3-4 times to Ditech. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating the modification could not be processed because of incomplete paperwork. I called Ditech to find out what paperwork was incomplete. I was told the REAL reason why the modification is not going though is because we already had more than 1 modification and have reached our limit. This was news to us! If this were true, why were we offered the modification by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and continued to go through the modification process through XX/XX/XXXX? In XXXX the following payments were made in an effort to catch up as best as we could : XX/XX/XXXX - {$1900.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$1900.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$1900.00} XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - {$3800.00} ( via money order ) + an additional {$3800.00} ( via money orders ) In XX/XX/XXXX a check in the amount of {$1900.00} was made to Ditech but {$1900.00} was cashed according to the bank. 

In XX/XX/XXXX we were offered a Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement wherein we were to pay {$2800.00} a month beginning XX/XX/XXXX and continue through XX/XX/XXXX. Once completed, we would be current. Even thought there was an additional $ 900+ above the {$1900.00} we were already paying, we agreed to the repayment plan in an effort to make things current and avoid foreclosure. We received the Supplements Repayment Plan which explained all of the terms, the amounts to be paid with due dates, etc. Ditechs agreement specifically stated that if we make the supplement repayment payments on or before the due date Ditech will not initiate foreclose proceedings or, if foreclosure has already been initiated, we will not proceed to foreclosure sale. We made our first payment in XX/XX/XXXX for {$2800.00} and our second payment in XX/XX/XXXX for {$2800.00}. When we made our payment in XX/XX/XXXX my bank confirmed the check was not cashed. On XXXX XXXX my check sent in XXXX was returned to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Ditech at XXXX and spoke to XXXX at XXXX  XXXX regarding my returned check sent in XXXX. She explained our check was returned because we are going through foreclosure. I explained we are under a Repayment Plan Agreement offered by Ditech. When I asked to speak to a Supervisor, I was placed on hold. XXXX came back to the phone and only told me that her Supervisor said the foreclosure status was removed and that I can send in my check in XXXX. I mailed my check for XXXX to Ditech on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, my check was never applied to the account and was returned to me on XX/XX/XXXX. Although I received letters from Ditech stating their moving forward with the foreclosure was in error and to resend the check, they continued the foreclosure process. When we received our XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX statements, they showed an outstanding balance of {$19000.00}, Corporate Advances of {$81000.00}, etc. 

Ditech breached its Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement by not accepting our agreed upon payment of {$2800.00} in exchange for not initiating foreclosure proceedings. As we were adhering to the Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement, Ditech initiated foreclosure proceedings which is dual tracking and in violation of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights. 

A certified Qualified Written Request dated XX/XX/XXXX was sent to Ditech referencing their breach of the Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement, dual tracking, discrepancy in payments made versus monies owed, a request for the breakdown of monies as noted in our XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX statements, a request for forbearance, and a request to come up with an amicably feasible amount between both parties in light of Ditechs unfair and unlawful handling. Ditech was advised that under Section 6 of RESPA they were required to acknowledge my request within 20 business days and resolve the issue within 60 business days. The certified letter was signed by a XXXX representative on XX/XX/XXXX. Ditech NEVER responded to our QWR letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. Instead, we received a NOTICE OF SERVICING TRANSFER dated XX/XX/XXXX advising that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was going to be our new servicer effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

Not only did Ditech breach the Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement and underwent dual tracking which is in violation of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, Ditech also failed to meet the duties of responding to the Qualified Written Request as defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by ( 1 ) not providing a written response acknowledging receipt of the correspondence within 5 days ; and ( 2 ) not providing a substantive response/making appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower to include any and all credits/conduct and investigation/provide the borrower with a written explanation or clarification which states the reasons the servicer believes the account is correct within 30 days. 

Our loan is currently with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Loan Number XXXX ). We have requested answers as to the discrepancies regarding the misapplication of monies versus amounts owed as well as an explanation as to why our Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement was breached by Ditech. Even though XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has taken over the handling of our mortgage, they maintain the position that they had nothing to do with Ditechs handling of our loan yet they ( 1 ) denied our request for a new Supplement Repayment Plan, ( 2 ) denied our request for a loan modification based on the fact that we did not have enough income and we have too much equity in the property, and ( 3 ) are moving forward with the foreclosure initiated by Ditech while we were involved in a Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement. 

Due to the inconsistent amounts owed, monies paid and not applied to the account, outstanding interests, late fees, Corporate Advance charges, etc., we are unable to pay the {$80000.00} plus arrear amount. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX has recorded a Notice of Default on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Although we became delinquent due to an unforeseen injuries and death, we attempted to make better the situation by aggreging to a Supplement Repayment Plan Agreement in order to avoid foreclosure and become current. Instead, Ditech unlawfully initiated foreclosure proceedings, made various violations pursuant to the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and RESPA, resulting in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX proceeding to foreclose on our home where we have lived in for 19 years and started a family consisting of XXXX daughters.

Ultimately it was decided there was a glitch with the electronic payment system and the returned payment fees were dropped from my account and I rescheduled the balance payments. 

- For the instance on XX/XX/XXXX, the Customer representative I spoke to at XXXX refused to participate in a call in XXXX, or contact XXXX on a separate call to verify that I had sufficient funds on that day, or to address my issue at all. Since this problem with payment has occurred at least three occasions, two which took considerable time and inconvenience to resolve, one which is still unresolved, I decided to close the credit card account.

They also told me that interest would continue to accrue, however, since the forgiveness amount ( up to {$17000.00} ) far exceeded my current balance ( close to {$9000.00} ), this was a reasonable option for me since I would be able to fully qualify in XX/XX/XXXX. So, I applied for forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and was approved by Nelnet. This year I applied again, however, this time I was denied.

The loan I was seeking to have forgiven was established in XX/XX/XXXX and was for my XXXX degree. The loan from XX/XX/XXXX was for my XXXX degree and was paid off long before I took out the XX/XX/XXXX loan. Nelnet then informed me that it was their mistake for allowing the forbearance for the past two years. I then complained saying that interest has been accruing and at this point I would have had only 2 years left on my note. Now I have 4 years plus additional interest due to the forbearance causing my monthly payment to be {$50.00} more than it was back in XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked the Nelnet advisor how they planned to monetarily fix their mistake, they said there was nothing they could do. The only action available to me was for the Nelnet advisor to type up a formal complaint. This discussion took place on XX/XX/XXXX.

My nonpublic personal information was used against me under false pretenses to coerce payment on these extensions of credit. I was never explained how to opt out of the disclosure any negative information that would jeopardize my consumer reputation if I didnt adhere to the terms. 

Upon further investigation, I uncovered that I was induced into an unconscionable adhesion contract that I feel would have been uncovered by XXXX if a reasonable investigation would have been conducted. I was told by these organizations that I would be receiving an cardholder agreement and loan disclosures of terms I had to adhere to. I was never given an option to opt out of anything.

Given the option, I would have chosen another financial institution. The mentioned organizations have engaged in racketeering activity by taking action to enforce these adhesion contracts and XXXX was knowingly complicit in this conspiracy to engage in human trafficking. 

This fraudulently furnished information violates TILA, FCRA, GLBA, the Sherman Antitrust Act, Robinson-Patman Act, Clayton Act , FTC Act, CFPA and RICO Act. In accordance with TILA, the finance charge is the sum of all charges. The above-mentioned financial institution included a provision in their agreements to embezzle my monthly credit balance. I would have never agreed to that provision if I was made aware that it existed. All payments made on this account were a result of threat, duress, and coercion due to undue influence. 

I explicitly disaffirm any alleged contract, whether, implied or explicit, between I and the financial institutions mentioned above. Due to unauthorized use of a credit card due to the above organizations acting in bad faith, XXXX was unjustly enriched.

The above-mentioned creditors may not collect any disputed amount. As a federally protected consumer, who does not need to pay, the creditor can not restrict, accelerate payment, close an account and or make or threaten any adverse reporting to any person about the consumer 's credit standing without resolving the billing error.

Received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CT XXXX stating they must regretfully inform me that they were not agreeable to handling the proposed transaction due to their decision based in whole or in part on the two agencies listed. XXXX and XXXX XXXX. XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX with a toll free number listed as XXXX gave a credit score of XXXX with a range of XXXX to XXXX which to me seemed fairly decent. The other company whom I have never heard of XXXX XXXX. Located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX with a toll free number of XXXX gave a credit score of XXXX with a range of 1 to 999 which seemed to me to be very low in comparison to the three major reporting agencies. When I attempted to make an inquiry to XXXX. They were requesting way to much information about me such as a copy of my drivers license as well as other personal information. I refuse to provide personal information to some company Ive never heard of. Their key factors stated ; limited history for consumer at address and phone number which Ive had for over 10 years. Not enough debt experience which Ive had for 30 years plus. Too few bank card accounts which Ive maintained for 30 years plus and limited history for consumer at this phone. My complaint comes from the fact that upon checking for reviews concerning XXXX I found at least 25 reviews with all reviews stating the same thing, a low credit score from XXXX after receiving high scores from the three major credit bureaus, which generated a high interest rate. This seems like a scam from XXXX or XXXX Bank to artificially raise interest rates on unwary consumers who are applying for credit or loans. This is apparent from the fact that if I had accepted their terms at XXXX XXXX I would have gotten the credit based on a 22 % interest rate. But due to the fact that I declined them they are now saying that they denied me based of my credit worthiness. I also reviewed the XXXX and they were not a member, which to me is another red flag.

A few days later I found out that my claim was denied because I had to report the claim dispute within 60 days of the transaction being posted.

Its really annoying because I know this claim should have been approved according to Chase and XXXX 's own guidelines on chargebacks and disputes.

My observation is the following : When the documentation was "" almost late '' a decision was made to cancel the real estate transaction because the law required a 3 day notice. This caused us much stress and change of plans and money as we had to cancel several appointment which we had applied a deposit. This XX/XX/18 settlement date had been in place for over a month. 

When NFCU employees make a mistake of not including my wife in the sign off of the closing disclosure and its consumer protections, it was ok to break the law and let the settlement stand so that they would not be embarrassed. 

Don't believe the law was intended to be one way, to discriminate against buyers whenever something occurs but "" bend '' the rules when it works the other way. 

Thank you for listening to my complaint. I desire no monetary damages from NFCU but would expect a letter of apololgy and a violation of the Truth in Lending Act.

I intentionally pay extra every month in order to minimize the interest I am paying, but Carrington 's policies and practices will not allow this by default. 

This mortgage was originated in XX/XX/XXXX and has always been current and in good standing. 

Details : Carrington Mortgage Services purchased my mortgage from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then I have made 3 payments of {$3000.00} each on XX/XX/XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX ( due XXXX   XXXX ), and XXXX XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ). Each of the {$3000.00} payments sent to Carrington included ~ {$1100.00} excess funds which should have been applied to my principal when each of the payments were received.

However, Carrington did not apply the funds as expected. 
( 1 ) for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, Carrington applied the funds as expected with excess payments being applied to principal. However, this payment was reversed and reapplied on XX/XX/XXXX with the excess payment ( {$1100.00} ) being swept into "" unapplied funds ''. Carrington only applied the MINIMUM payment to my principal for the bill due XX/XX/XXXX. 
( 2 ) for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, Carrington also only applied the MINIMUM payment to my principal for the bill due XX/XX/XXXX. The excess payment ( ~ {$1100.00} ) was swept into "" unapplied funds ''. OnXX/XX/XXXX, the balance in "" unapplied funds '' was then used to pay the mortgage bill due XX/XX/XXXX. Again, the MINIMUM payment to principal was made. 
( 3 ) for the XX/XX/XXXXpayment, Carrington swept the entire payment to "" unapplied funds ''.

Under my former lender, my principal decreased by ~ {$1200.00} per month but under Carringto
n they are only allowing my principal to decrease by {$450.00} per month. 

I have called Carrington weekly to try and understand the situation. Carrington has been able to explain their practices, which are the root cause of this problem. The only solution that Carrington has to offer is to watch the account and then call them if I do not agree with how they have applied my payments. 

It is clear that Carrington is applying my payments in a manner to maximize the interest accruing on the account while leaving my extra payments in a non-interest-bearing "" unapplied funds '' sub-account.

I initiated a wire transfer in the amount of {$15000.00} on Wednesday, XX/XX/2022 via XXXX Online Banking, around XXXX XXXX. I promptly lost power, data and cellular service as a result of the storm. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I was able to recieve an email from what I believed to be my closing agent asking where the funds were. I called my closing agent directly and was informed the instructions had not been sent by them. I promptly engaged XXXXXXXX XXXX and was advised that the team I needed ( Wire Investigations Team ) could only be contacted via the Secure Message Center ( SMC ) in XXXX Online Banking. Based on this information, I reached out to said team via the XXXX. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved a response from the XXXX XXXX Investigations Team ( via the XXXX ) confirming the details of the wire and requesting my conscent to recall that wire. My conscent was provided. 

On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved a follow up message from the same team via the XXXX stating that the recieving bank ( Navy Federal Credit Union ) had flagged the transfer as suspicious and that the funds had not yet been released to the recipient account. Furthermore, the XXXX XXXX Investigations Representative advised that I could visit a local banking center and work with a Banking Center Manager to submit a Hold Harmless Letter ( HHL ) to Navy Federal Credit Union so that the funds could be returned. 

As this was recieved after business hours, I set out to visit a local branch on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. The Banking Center Manager was not familiar with the requested HHL and spent the next 3 hours on the phone with her internal support teams. Eventually she was able to reach a teammate that was familiar with the HHL. This teammate advised that the form was no longer used HHLs at XXXX and when it was in use, its intent was to cover bank employee errors and not intended for client use. 

In an attempt to assist, the XXXX Banking Center Manager reached out to Navy Federal Credit Union ( NFCU ) on an internal line. She explained the situation to a representative of NFCU - that the wire was submitted via fraudulent means, that she had issued a recall and that the funds should be returned to my account. The representative from NFCU advised they would be unable to return the funds without an HHL, to which the XXXX representative advised that her institution no longer supported/issued these forms. NFCU advised there was no plan b, and when asked what would happen to the funds, the NFCU representative advised they were not at liberty to disclose nor should I ( as the client ) have been made aware that the funds were not yet released. 

The XXXX Banking Center Manager apologized profusely for the situation and filed a formal complaint on my behalf. 

On XX/XX/2022 My legal counsel sent a letter to NFCU requesting the immediate return of the funds. 

To date NFCU has not replied to the letter from my attorney. 

In the interim I attempted to engage XXXX 's Wire Investigations Team via the Secure Message Center. My initial note was responded to within XXXX hours. I have engage them now 3 times requesting an update and have each time recieved automated responses advising me that a response would be recieved within XXXX business days. 

My complaint is two-fold. 

Complaint One : The fact that XXXX Bank 's Wire Investigations Team is only availible via Secure Message Center is unacceptable. When it comes to fraudulent wire transfers, or any fradulent activity for that matter, all actions to investigate and potentially recall funds is time sensitive. Clients should not have to submit a message, recieve an auto response and wait XXXX hours ( or XXXX business days ) to be contacted by a representative. Submitting a claim against fraudulent activity is my right as a client, and XXXX limiting my ability to file a claim in a timely manner is unacceptable. 

Complaint 2 : Navy Federal Credit Union has now been advised by myself, my banking institution and my attorney that the transfer was sent by fraudulent means and should be returned to my account. NFCU themselves flagged the transaction as suspicious. The fact that the funds have not been returned to my account is not acceptable",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,FL,34119,,Consent provided,Web,2022-10-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6093661

On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that Wells Fargo received a debit from XXXX ( a credit card that I have paid many times via my checking account ) will not be paid because of insufficient funds and possible fraud. 
I called their customer service and after escalating it to a manager. I was told that the checks were not being paid and they were not sure about the funds being available. I asked her to contact XXXX XXXX and she informed me that this isn't how it works. She then told me that I need to contact XXXX XXXX because XXXX did NOT pay out the checks.

I contacted the Branch Manager of Wells Fargo XXXXXXXX XXXX  and told him that I was not happy with this and that I contacted XXXX XXXX and that the funds were cashed already by Wells Fargo. I was paying interest on the Home Equity Line of Credit and that we were cashed XXXX  days ago and XXXX days ago and that I wanted to know WHERE the money was. He informed me that there is nothing he could do and that he will put in a report to have this reviewed by upper management or a department that handles this. He was rude and told me that the funds were being held due to Regulation CC. I was not familiar with this and did some research on this law and from what I was reading ; Regulation CC was created to protect the consumer. Basically checks were now able to be cashed electronically oppose to needing the hard copy check so that it would save time. This seemed almost Ironic that he mentioned this and that the funds were indeed cashed and they were not releasing the funds. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX and both the teller and the branch manager told me that Wells Fargo can contact them to verify the funds are available and have been cashed. The Branch Manager of Wells Fargo told me that he won't do this and that there is nothing he can do to help. 
I called Wells Fargo Customer Service AGAIN and was talking to a much nicer representative. She was not able to help but she did tell me that the check was being held due to potential fraud. So now I have 3 different reasons given to me from Wells Fargo. 
I am not sure why it is considered or being held because of Fraud. I am not a new customer. I never had any issues with my bank account in the past. I checked my activity in my wells fargo accounts and everything seemed normal activity.

The process got underway and over the next several weeks I provided all the documents required for the approval process to move forward. I provided several years of paycheck stubs, W-2 's for the last 2 or 3 years, last 2-3 years of official Tax returns as well as homeowners insurance, property tax statements, investment property documents among many other things. All along the same time my Tax Attorney & Tax Accountant ( CPA ) provided me guidance and gave me no reason why I would not be approved for a HELOC. The home was appraised at over {$630000.00} and I owe just over {$310000.00} on the home to the bank which gives me just at 50 % equity in my property. I was approved by Chase for {$180000.00} HELOC which is roughly what was allowed by lending guidelines for me to get as a loan. Long story short is that I was contacted by the bank on XX/XX/2019 and was told by XXXX that they could not extend me a HELOC due to my income to debt ratio. I make about {$130000.00} per year in income from my employer, have about {$8000.00} in rental income each year and have equity in my home as well as all my other investment properties are completely debt free. I have no other debts, no credit card debt, no automobile loans at all and have a FICO credit score of XXXX. When XXXX contacted me about this and gave me the news that Chase could not extend me a loan ; I pushed back and disagreed with the decision. I pushed back even further and told her that if Chase could not extend me a loan then I needed Chase to send me a letter stating such and why as well as send me all the paperwork that went into the decision as to why I was being denied the loan. I then got a call from Chase today XX/XX/2019 where they further explained their decision but after further review they were going to extend me a credit line of {$28000.00} or so. I find this really hard to believe that with my credit score & equity in home that the bank can not provide me access to my own equity in my home. I believe I have been deceived by Chase Bank as their own employees can not agree on what I qualify for by changing their position after I pushed back at the initial decline of credit. I have not received a loan decline letter yet but should receive this shortly. I am not sure if why they would not loan someone with great income, impeccable credit score and no debt other than my primary residence a loan but something is not right about this.

I was confused because my balance left was {$40.00}, and after charging me. I first spoke to an agent named XXXX who was extremely condescending who explained to me because the card authorization made my available balance negative. I was then transferred to a Manager named XXXX. 

The issue stands here. I was charged an overdraft fee because of a pending authorization which was a mistake by the vendor and has not posted. So I was charged an overdraft fee based on my available balance and then I would be charged another overdraft tomorrow when this authorization posts. 

I spoke with XXXX extensively and he let me know that I would be charged fees based on my available balance availability even if a transaction never posts. Meaning, that if an authorization was a mistake and the vendor never collects Bank of America will leave that fee on my account. I found 5 fees like that in XXXX. I found multiple other fees like that in the past 6 months. Where Bank of America charged me overdraft fees, for authorizations and then when that authorization posts. 

I then went to page 10 of my client disclosure packet. None of these parameters were documented in that packet at all. Nothing about being charged fees based on available balance. It only said balance. Nothing about being charged for an authorized item and then again when that same item posts. There are already {$240.00} in fees including the one for XXXX which will post tomorrow. I calculated another {$700.00} in fees the last 6 months using this abusive tactic. 

I went into a deep dive in managing my account in order to avoid this issue. I would like all my fees reversed. I would like a letter of apology for this abusive behavior. I want my account to go without any banking fees for the next 6 months as a show of good faith, that I will not be taken advantage of again. 

I also want Bank of America to make full disclosure of these fee practices in the client disclosure booklet. Because even when I read it to been, he said it agreed with him. But the booklet makes no distinction between the two balance and available balance. Nor states we can be charged two times for one transaction. 

I was even told I wasn't charged for my transaction, but was charged because of my available balance.

Shortly after it was closed by American Express ; about 2-3 months after it was closed I begin receiving called from a debt collector stating that American Express had turned over the debt to them. I amount stated was several thousands more than my authorized charges. I immediately did two things- I notified the debt collector that the debt was not mine and that the amount reported was higher than any amount I ever used. I suspected fraud. I notified them both verbally and a couple days later in writing. I further sent them a debt validation letter per the Fair Debt Practices Act formally requesting that the collector validates the debt and clearly stating my dispute of this debt. Additionally that same day I contacted American Express and communicated the same thing to them. I was told that they no longer had the account and that I should only communicate with the debt collector to resolve it. After a few months of waiting on the debt collector, I received another call from the same debt collector demanding payment. I asserted again that I had previously sent a debt validation letter ( the amount that was claimed was and is still in dispute ). After speaking with a supervisor I was informed that American Express had not yet responded to their request in order to provide me the information as required by law. I was further told that they were going to send the debt back to American Express and I would not receive any more calls or letters from them. Per their word, I never heard from that debt collector again. However, about five months later a different debt collector hired by American Express began contacting me. I again informed them verbally and by mail within the required 30 days that the amount of debt was incorrect and I sent them a formal debt validation letter per the Fair Debt Practices Act formally requesting that the collector validates the debt and clearly stating my dispute of this debt. Again, I heard nothing for several weeks. I again called American Express who again said that they no longer had the debt and that I needed to discuss my account with the debt collector. After several weeks I called the debt collector and was told similar to the first debt collector that American Express had not responded to their request and they had nothing to provide me. Apparently that debt collector sent the account back to American Express. I never heard from them again. Sadly this process would happen once more ( now for the third time with again a different debt collector ). Again, the same request and again American Express did not respond to apparently the debt collector they hired to collect on this debt that was not mine. After the third debt collector sent the debt back to American Express I heard nothing else from any additional debt collectors hired by American Express, nor did I hear from American Express in over a year.

American Express has reported to all three major credit reporting agencies this debt, in spite of knowing for several years that I disputed the debt due to fraud. American Express had refused to comply with federal laws governing debt reporting and fraud investigation request by a consumer. Instead American Express had used three different debt collection agencies to try and ignore the requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Act. The have bluntly violated the requirements by hopping from debt collector to debt collector knowing full well that the debt is not mine, and making no attempt to follow the requirements of the FDCA. I am asking that a full investigation into their blatant violation and disregard of the Fair Debt Collection Act, be opened. As of todays date American Express still has not opened a fraud investigation, nor communicated the results of this fraud, and in spite of four requests for validation of the debt- choose to ignore all three and instead hop from debt collector to debt collector instead of complying with FDCA .",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,IL,60077,,Consent provided,Web,2022-08-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5878766

Freedom ignored multiple suggestions that our mortgage interest expense for XXXX would not be accurately reported to us. In fact, not until XX/XX/XXXX did they provide what appears to be an accurate Form 1098 - several weeks after such information can be used for reconciling XXXX taxes. 

Freedom has not responded to our request for a new amortization schedule pertinent to the referenced loan, and has failed to respond to our request for copies of any negative information Freedom may have provided to credit reporting entities.

Freedom has also ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) billed us for a Property Inspection Fee,  which is not provided for in the loan agreement - but which is consistent with practices of some mortgage companies when they consider loans to be delinquent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,VA,23188,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3253826

FYI, this is only part of the system issues. BoA 's credit card payment does not show how much is left of the previous monthly statement to pay off for full amounts, and the account site often erases payment information.

I disregarded until I received a second bill stating that I owed for the entirety of the balance for the phones.

That company closed suddenly and without notice. A couple of weeks later I start getting collection calls from World Finance   claiming they purchased the contracts from XXXX  XXXX and I owed the debt to them. World Finance had already put a late fee on my loan even though I had no idea who this company was. I worked with the company trying to make arrangements to pay as their collection calls were coming in at least 3 times a day every weekday. If I didn't pick up the phone, they would call my friends and relatives whom I had listed as references on my XXXX XXXX accounts. 
I finally wanted World Finance to prove to me that I owed them the debt from the other loan company. They sent what was claimed to be a "" court document '' to prove they bought my loan. It was just a typed up document with no official markings like a judge 's signature or a docket number. 
When I informed World Finance that I would be a filing an official complaint against them, the manager became more aggressive and demeaning ( even yelling at me ) insisting I was just trying to get out of my debt. He then informed me he would put it on my credit report if I didn't pay. After about 6 months of harassing me, my friends and family, I was able to block all of their phone numbers. Unfortunately my friends and family were not able to do so. 
I pay debts that are mine, but they are expecting me to pay a random company I have never done business with just on their word.

In addition, the first payment of {$500.00} was not posted until the next day of origination ( the XXXX, during the call ), so the balance shown in collections was already post-payment ( not the original {$2000.00} balance and which also shows an invalid date of XX/XX/XXXX, not the XXXX ) which shows that the debt collector issued this credit hold after explaining the terms of the payment plan and setting the agreement that this would not be reflected on my credit report. 


After calling EOS CCA on 3 separate occasions on XX/XX/2019, they initially found no record of a conversation with a previous representative, but acknowledged the fact that a payment plan was in place and that there must've been contact. They also explained that there should have been no agreement with the representative and that they would never strike a deal to "" not '' inform the credit bureaus. They explained that they would review the tapes and that I was supposed to call back within 48 hours to speak with a manager. 


EOS CCA misrepresented, misinformed and mishandled me and my information. Without transparency and releasing of the tapes they have on file of my conversation that set the agreement with their representative, I am at the mercy of EOS CCA and their managers, despite of holding my end of the agreement up, giving them the chance to further mishandle and manipulate me.",,"EOS Holdings, Inc.",NY,14141,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3247616

Later I received notice that this change was postponed until XX/XX/2022. 

on XX/XX/2022 I, XXXX XXXX, sent a check from XXXX bank to HSBC USA to pay off the remaining balance of my credit card account, in the amount of {$2300.00}.

XX/XX/2022 My account was charged a Return Check Fee. 

XX/XX/2022 I called XXXX bank and there was no evidence of a check submitted by, or returned to HSBC USA. XXXX advised me that the check was never submitted to them by HSBC USA and no check was denied by XXXX bank. I then called HSBC USA and was told multiple times that the check was returned by my bank and denied.

20335,2022-07-30,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"When I opened the small business credit card account reacting to {$750.00} marketing cash back offer at {$7500.00} spent within 120 days, I was told that the company will honor the offer. Since the credit limit was sent at {$1000.00} per statement ( despite having a XXXX credit rating and no debt ) I was told by the US Bank Executive team member that in order to overcome the {$1000.00} limit and still meet the required spend I have to keep making payments at {$1000.00} intervals to free up credit for the transaction. This worked until XXXX when all of the sudden and without warning the US Bank decided to transfer the payment to a central payment escrow account thus freezing the available credit at {$1000.00} regardless of positive balance exceeding it. I attempted to work with the bank using following : 1 ) close the other US bank credit card account to increase the available credit : denied 2 ) increase the credit limit available : denied but available after 180 days review period which will put it behind the XX/XX/2022 {$750.00} marketing offer expiry 3 ) requested to have the offer to be extended to XX/XX/2022 ( an additional billing period so the billing spent can be met ) ; denied. 
4 ) requested the payments to be made to the card directly instead of the central payment escrow account : denied. I was told that the transfer of the central credit payment to direct credit card payment will take 1-2 billing cycles thus it will take place after the expiry of the XX/XX/2022 deadline making it useless. 

I was also not informed why the central bill pay is mandatory at the US Bank as the company is actually holding the money in escrow instead of applying it the very day it received it but I was informed that it is done "" automatically. '' This is despite the fact that I didn't ask for the billing to be done this way and contrary to my wishes. Subsequently the bank also denied a confirmation that the transfer of the central pay escrow to direct card pay will not affect the points already accrued on the account as result of the transactional activities. 
So in the last pay period I have had the following totals ( since XX/XX/2022 ) : {$300.00} positive balance {$1000.00} payment {$630.00} payment {$1000.00} credit limit {$2900.00} ( that if direct pay should be more than enough to meet the {$7500.00} spend ( as of XX/XX/2022 : $ XXXX XXXX {$7600.00} ). 
However as of today the card despite reaching an overall limit of spend at {$7000.00} ( {$480.00} more to go as of XX/XX/2022 ) the transactions going forward are being rejected : XX/XX/2022 {$90.00} XXXX XX/XX/2022 {$14.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2022 {$54.00} XXXX It is obvious that the US Bank is blocking these transaction on purpose and keeping the payments already made in account pay escrow so the {$7500.00} is not met thus the offer 's terms will not be met by XX/XX/2022. 
After the offer deadline passes the US Bank will apply the credit to the account however it will be too late to collect what is owed. It is very disappointing that the US Bank will be playing games such as these and structuring its credit products in bad faith so the customers are not made whole. I attempted to be flexible and offer the bank several ways to address this issue but not to avail. It also appears that the advice given to me in XX/XX/2022 to address this problem by the US bank executive office was given in bad faith as shortly after my payments were stopped being credited to the account and sent instead to the central pay escrow.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,IL,60073,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5826636

At that time, my assets inside my Celsius account totaled roughly {$1.00} million in equivalent US Dollar value, and were comprised of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and others. 
Just days before the freeze, the CEO of Celsius XXXX XXXX was boasting that all assets were completely safe and that everyone has complete access to their assets. Indeed, for years XXXX constantly boasted about how Celsius was safer than a bank -- suggesting that our assets were not only completely safe, but that we'd be utter fools to use banks instead of Celsius, especially with that "" sweet yield '' we were earning. After XX/XX/2022 as an accredited investor I moved assets into CUSTODY to add an extra layer of safety to some holdings. Holding assets in CUSTODY meant that the assets were not earning any yield, and they could be readily accessible at any time. 

In early XX/XX/2022 I pledged approximately {$400000.00} in XXXX from CUSTODY to become collateral for a {$100000.00} USDC loan against my digital assets. This four to one ratio of collateral to debt ( 25 % LTC ) enabled me to gain some capital access at 2.95 % annual interest rate and most prominently allowed me to access some of the value of my appreciated coin valuations without selling any assets and incurring taxes.

In summary, I have coins held in the EARN account, in the CUSTODY account, and pledged as collateral on a LOAN, which I would gladly pay off to rightfully recover possession of my digital assets.

Not only is it now readily apparent that Celsius LIED to us extensively by taking massive undisclosed risks with our assets and covering up the truth of their beleaguered financial status, but after being exposed they are now using OUR assets to seek compensating themselves and paying attorneys to help exonerate them from their gross negligence and heinous acts of mismanagement and perhaps, extensive fraudulent and 'Ponzi scheme ' related activities.

In XXXX I was forced to refinance my second mortgage with Suntrust Mortgage. 

This was to refinance a XXXX Massachusetts High Cost Home Loan with SunTrust Mortgage. 

Suntrust never properly rectified the original high cost home loan. They claim they had refunded me the interest of the previous loan, but this money was used for closing costs of the new loan. All of the funds of the previous loan went into the closing of the new loan. They also did not properly notify me that they were in violation of the statue. 

This created a new Massachusetts High Cost Home loan since I paid the closing cost. Suntrust has denied this, but I was able to obtain the check that I was then forced to sign over to attorney for closing costs. This is fraud. 

Since this was a Massachusetts High Cost Home Loan, I had an extended right to rescind. 

I exercised this absolute right to rescind which SunTrust ignored. They did not dispute or in any way argue against this recession. I have attached the rescission letter, and email I had sent. I also attached the USPS form that shows SunTrust received this rescission. 

Since this loan was rescinded SunTrust does not have the right to report this a mortgage account. 

I had previously been offered {$15000.00} to settle this loan. In a previous complaint SunTrust had said that they had not record of this. I still have these records and have also attached them. 

In short Suntrust does not have the right to report the mortgage since it was properly rescinded and they never disputed this rescission.

Four years ago I lost my full-time job so I was struggling with keeping up with payments. Up to this point I didnt have any problem paying the bills on time. 

Ive contacted the company several times during my financial hardship and kept on stressing that I do not want the account closed, but that I would pay off whatever was on it ; there wasnt a lot. I told them I would keep sending money in, and not use the card, until it was paid in full. Consumers are always told to stay in touch with the creditor, and I did. They kept on assuring me that I was doing the right thing by staying in contact with them, sending in payments even if it didnt cover the monthly amount, and that my card would not be cancelled. 

A few months after I had gotten my balance down to XXXX, and paid off everything ( even the late fees, etc. ), they send me a letter that they cancelled my card. My credit score was climbing back up, and I get hit with this! They gave me the form letter about my credit report saying that I have too many derogatories and too many accounts past due.

The initial loan amount for one of the loans was {$17000.00} and that went into repayment on XX/XX/XXXX. The interest rate on this loan is a variable interest rate and is currently at 11.24 % interest. However, in nearly 7 years of making payments the balance on the loan as of the last statement for XX/XX/XXXX is {$17000.00}. We believe that this is a result of predatory lending. On the statement it even shows that we have paid a total of {$20000.00} with {$6000.00} of that supposedly going towards principal. 
Our second loan also went into repayment on XX/XX/XXXX but that initial loan amount was for {$8000.00}. The variable interest rate on this loan is currently 5.25 %. As of the XX/XX/XXXX statement it has said that we have paid a total of {$5800.00} with {$3300.00} of that being principal. However the remaining loan principal on this account is {$6100.00}. 

We believe that both of these loans were included in the XXXX predatory lending case, but were never sent any information about a class action.

I can no longer continue when they tell me that everything is already lost. In pain I have already learned to live, in frustration I am afraid to live.

They told me that they would stop the sale so that the bank would give me the opportunity to reach a settlement. 

I do not intend to get rid of my payments. I want the property returned to me. I am working. I can show that I can continue with the payments. I also applied for Mortgage Relief. It is pending. I need legal help as soon as possible to see everything from the sale of the property and review the loan contract. I feel that something is wrong with the contract because they started the loan with a 9.99 % interest rate for just one year. They raised the interest rate to 20.87 %, the rate they never mentioned to me when signing the contract. Today I only heard it say that I had already lost the property. I need help, please, somehow recover the property. I can show that I will not have problems with future payments, but the bank did not listen to me...

Based on the financial information presented in the estimate, I decided that the savings I would see each month in my monthly payment from the lower interest rate and lower PMI it would be worth my time, money, effort, and hit to my credit score. He quoted me a PMI of $ XXXX/month. I filled out the loan application and provided all of the requested documentation. While waiting for conditional approval of my loan, I started receiving email communications from a few other employees regarding my loan. A new loan officer had taken over my loan and I had learned that XXXX was no longer with the company. I then emailed my new loan officer, XXXX XXXX, to ask if it were possible that I might be eligible for a lower interest rate or pmi than I was quoted based on the fact that my appraisal came in XXXX higher than anticipated. He said he would look into it. His response was a closing disclosure that had a higher pmi and a higher loan amount. In discussing the disparities in cost between the loan estimate and the closing disclosure, XXXX told me that he could not figure out how XXXX came up with XXXX for the PMI. He concluded that he must have entered the number manually and that he shouldn't have done that. I explained that the only reason I decided to proceed with procuring the loan was because of the savings I was quoted. XXXX said that the best rate he could find me was XXXX. He said that he was pretty sure that his company was going to have to eat the cost of the difference. He also said that underwriting was still taking a look at it to get it fixed on my disclosure. After a few days had passed I got a phone call from a VP at On Q to tell me they could not honor the pmi I was quoted and that my only 2 options were to either accept the new loan terms or cancel. He said that he couldnt legally pay the difference of my pmi. 

I believe that he is trying to prey on my ignorance of financial laws and regulations. I don't believe that an increase in pmi is justified when I didn't ask for any loan adjustments and my appraisal actually came in higher than anticipated.

On XX/XX/2019 I sold a {$400.00} gift card for the amount of {$380.00} on XXXX. I received an email from both XXXX and PayPal, informing me about the sale. The buyer subsequently wrote asking for the gift card in order to use online. At this time, I confirmed that the username messaging me through the XXXX  messaging system matched the user name listed on the PayPal transaction and email. ( Please see attachment labeled username ). As you can see, the username I wrote to on XXXX, matches the username PayPal gave me. At this time the person via XXXX  confirmed receipt ; they left positive feedback confirming that they spent the gift card ( please see attachment labeled positive XXXX feedback ). As you can see there is no question that the username PayPal provided me used the gift card. On XX/XX/2019 I received an email from PayPal stating that the transaction for my gift card was unauthorized, siting that there was suspicious activity on the buyers PayPal account. PayPal then took the money out of my account leaving me with a negative balance of {$380.00}. Outraged, I called PayPal asking what they problem was. They told me that the buyer did not authorize the charge and because it was a nontangible good, ( since I messaged the person the gift card number via XXXX secure messaging system ) I am not protected under seller protection, and I am therefore responsible for the unauthorized transaction. How am I, the XXXX seller responsible for PayPals poor security? I am not asking to be protected under seller protection, I am asking PayPal to be held responsible for their security mistake. This does not make any sense that I would be held responsible for a mistake made my PayPal. It is PayPals responsibility to ensure accounts are secured, and if they dont, they need to be held responsible for their mistakes. The innocent XXXX seller should not have to eat the money, as I have nothing to do with their security practices, or in this case, lack thereof. When I was on the phone with the PayPal representative, I asked her what suspicious activity they found. She told me that the purchase was either made in a different state other than the account holders address, or an unrecognized device was used ( XXXX instead of XXXX or vice a versa ). This brings me to personal stories exemplifying PayPals poor security. I recently made a trip to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I live in Maryland ). I attempted to purchase a subway card for just {$10.00} using my XXXX XXXX debit card. My card was declined, and minutes later ( unlike PayPal ) I received a call from XXXX XXXX asking if this was an authorized transaction. If this purchase was occurring in a different state, why was the buyers transaction ( for much more money ) declined until they could either say yes, the charge was from them, or no the charge was not authorized. It is PayPals responsibility to flag suspicious purchases ( quickly, not take weeks, especially ones as large as mine ) and require customers to secure their accounts. Second, I have a credit card with XXXX. I always login to XXXX via my XXXX. I marked my XXXX  as an authorized device. Occasionally I will use my desktop to login. Because my desktop is not an authorized device, XXXX sends me a text message to the phone number I have on file, with a security code to allow me to login on the unrecognized device. I wanted to test to see what would happened if my brother, who lives in a different state than I do, logged into my PayPal using his XXXX phone. I gave him my username and password and asked him to log in and try to make a purchase. He had no problem not only logging in, but also was able to make a purchase from another state. As you can see PayPal has terrible security, and fails to protect customers account. I should not, under any circumstances, be held responsible for someone cracking into this users PayPal account. It is PayPals liability to ensure that transactions are being made by the account holder, and if they do not, as in my case, they should be out the money, not the seller who has no ability to improve PayPals security.

Of course 3-4 business days has passed and no contact has been made with me regarding the outcome. Over the phone, their responses confirmed that they could not be trusted because I used logic and sequence to reason with them, and they could not provide a logical response. Another reason why they can not be trusted is because they claim to have sent me emails regarding my account, which over the years of having my email account, I never received a single email until I contacted them and told them to send me emails to make sure they they tell me on the phone is on paper in email. The phone reps just constantly give me a runaround and provide no meaningful response when I ask a straightforward question.

We simply dont know where else to turn, as you will understand after reading our story. 

For the past 10 years, weve lived with the knowledge that our home is in pre-foreclosure status despite our best efforts to secure a loan modification from XXXX, XXXX XXXX, EverBank and now TIAA Bank. Full disclosure : We did renege on a previous modification that was unfairly handled by the banks ; for two years, we made monthly payments of {$2400.00}, but we simply could not afford the inexplicable 50 % increase to {$3600.00}.

Weve been told various different reasons why we dont qualify, creditworthiness, financial, not enough equity and the investor, who we've been told is XXXX XXXX but supposedly is XXXX, just won't approve it. The first time about five years ago was supposedly due to our credit, despite the fact that we had credit scores over 700 ; we have no car, student loan, or credit card debt ; and our small business has experienced exponential growth over the past few years, significantly improving our financial situation. 

We are taxpayers, members of the XXXX XXXX Chamber of Commerce, and supporters of our military and veterans as well as many local charities. Were assets to our community, even with the potential of losing our home hanging over our heads. It has also been a huge stress on my wife 's senior mother who we help out by having her live with us. 

We have an excellent accountant whos been helping us with the loan modification paperwork and has quite a bit of evidence to support that weve been given the run-around by the lenders. He also has two other clients in our same exact situation but different banks and he was able to get them both a loan modification. Weve paid thousands of dollars in legal fees over the past 5 years to prevent a foreclosure, but are truly stumped over what to do next. Were not even sure who owns our loan, as it was securitized. It was transferred to XXXX by a confirmed robo-signer and now XXXX XXXX claims ownership out of thin air. 

Its important to note that had a modification been approved 5 years ago, the money that went to our attorney and accountant would have gone toward paying down our loan. Instead, our arrears have increased, making it harder to get the loan modification and putting our house in a negative equity position.

However, Bank of America has still closed my account. 

Now this situation has negatively affected my credit due to the closed account, and they will not reopen my account without requiring me to reapply as if I'm a brand new customer. Even though they claim responsibility for the error.

During the evening of Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I visited my local XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, VA to workout. Unfortunately, when I finished working out and was walking out of the gym, I had discovered that my car was burglarized including my right back passenger door window which was broken into, along with purse which was stolen throughout this process. I reported the break-in to the local XXXX XXXX Police Department by immediately dialing XXXX. The local police who were assigned to the XXXX, VA Police precinct were then dispatched to the gym. I then took immediate action to lock both my Wells Fargo checking and savings accounts online by using the Wells Fargo online banking website. I then took immediate steps to call Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . directly to ensure that my checking and savings accounts were officially locked. I further requested that my stolen debit card be immediately canceled and specifically asked that a note be placed on my account alerting I was a current victim of identity theft. The representative on the call then confirmed that my checking and savings accounts were locked through a hard freeze which would prevent any withdrawals or check/transfer deposits from taking place. I received confirmation numbers for both the checking and savings accounts and was asked to follow up in person at a local bank branch office near my home ( XXXX, VA ). I was instructed by the representative on the call that in regard to the stolen or theft of my debit card, I would need to be assisted by a banker in-person to open a new checking and saving accounts. 
On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX VA. Per my scheduled Wells Fargo in-person appointment, I was attended by a personal banker by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was able to assist with closing my old savings account and opened a new saving account per my request. I requested that my new savings account be protected by remaining locked to prevent any withdrawals. I was assured that my savings account would be protected at the time of this actual request. XXXX XXXX stated that there would be no need for alarm or concern and that no estimated amount of money could be withdrawn by anyone ( specifically the strangers or thieves who are still in possession of my drivers license and Wells Fargo debit card ). XXXX XXXX could not assist me further with closing my checking account as there was a pending deposit. I was requested to return back to the branch on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX to see if this request had been processed and/or completed. 
As requested, I visited the Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX the next day, Saturday at XXXXXXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX completed the same steps with closing and opening a new checking account. Once again, I asked that my new checking and saving accounts be protected against any withdrawal activity. I was assured that all correct steps were taken by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . and I had no need to worry. 
On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX, I received a call from a personal banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX, from Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . in XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). XXXX XXXX asked if I had recently authorized to have money withdrawn from my account. I acknowledged that she was speaking with me and clearly stated NO, I DO NOT AUTHORIZE WITHDRAWAL OF MY FUNDS. I immediately informed XXXX XXXX about my car being burglarized, including my drivers license and debit card being stolen. I informed XXXX XXXX to inform her manager and the banks XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX division to place a note on my checking and savings account. This would alert bank tellers to take note of the attempted withdrawal of my account. XXXX XXXX informed me that her XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, assisted and did not authorize the withdrawal. However, she apologized, that even though I informed her of the theft of my identify, my drivers license and debit card were returned by her to the thieves prior to reaching out to me via phone call.

XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$3500.00} XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$3500.00} I immediately rushed to the Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, VA and was attended to by banking representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX assisted to place a hard-freeze on my checking and savings account. The accounts were locked but in the process of locking the accounts, another withdrawal of {$3500.00} took place and XXXX XXXX was unable to stop this withdrawal, but notified the Wells Fargo security/alert banking division and stated that someone was falsely representing me by presenting my stolen drivers license and debit card. This was when an additional total of {$9300.00} was immediately withdrawn from my savings account. 

At this point, the fear of having more issues caused by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . due to negligence and failure to protect my funds, I requested XXXX XXXX to withdraw all remaining funds from my checking and saving accounts and issue official cashiers checks in the remaining amount of {$45000.00}. XXXX XXXX was not willing to comply with my request due to the time being past XXXXXXXX XXXX eastern standard time. XXXX XXXX did schedule an appointment for me to meet with fellow Wells Fargo branch representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX the following day. I left the bank with XXXX XXXX providing me with a newly issued Wells Fargo case number for the claim of the stolen amount of {$9300.00}. I was assured funds would be returned to me in 10 business days, due to this being Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.s mistake, and by them failing to stop withdrawals. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX, I visited the Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, VA and was attended to by Wells Fargo personal banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX successfully withdrew the remaining funds from both my checking and saving account and issued official cashiers checks. I was informed that the funds were immediately available and could deposit the amount into an alternate banking institution of my choice. I asked XXXX XXXX several times if it is correct that the cashiers checks were not an issue for me to deposit into an alternate banking institution and that Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . will not prevent me from depositing funds into another banking institution. XXXX XXXX confirmed once again this wouldnt be an issue. I further questioned XXXX XXXX if indeed Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . was going to return my {$9300.00} that the bank teller gave to the party who fraudulently tried to represent me with my original drivers license and Wells Fargo debit card. XXXX XXXX apologized and said it is not likely that the funds will be returned because there may be additional investigation and that I would need to wait to receive communication by mail. I asked once again why I am to wait for my funds to be returned. Funds that were freely given to the fraudulent thieves who had stolen my drivers license and debit card. 

XXXX XXXX said she did not know and all she could say for me was to wait but the odds of receiving the stolen fund amount of {$9300.00} within the next 10 days from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A would be pretty slim. I asked further if anyone working as a bank teller or cashier or personal banker can see the notes and find that my account was on alert watch. XXXX XXXX said it is hard to say because some bank staff do not read the notes and do not follow the correct process. 

My next issue occurred when I tried to deposit my newly issued cashiers checks from Wells Fargo into my alternate banking institution named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that funds would be available the next day. However, when I checked this account online the next day. I had discovered that the funds were not available and immediately called XXXX XXXX to inquire. I reached out to Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . by calling the XXXX # and filed a complaint, which was escalated so I could speak with the Wells Fargo executive office . I was informed that even through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A, issued me an official cashiers check. Wells Fargo still placed a hold on the newly issued cashiers check, and there is no guarantee that the funds would be released to me now within the expected time frame of 5 days. 
At the moment, not only did Wells Fargo Bank, N.A fail to protect my funds from theft. They also gave my funds without my consent. I am now left without any money and am at the mercy of Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . to fix this issue and address the failures that took place. I am deeply discouraged and exhausted which is due to me needing to call repetitively and speak with representatives with no assurance of when my stolen funds will be distributed back to me.

None of the actions taken by WF is technically illegal. WF announced by letter that the bank was amending the terms of its Line of Credit Agreements to allow the bank, without prior notice, to close the account if it had had no activity for one year. I spoke to customer service, informing them that the ability to close the account without notice had an effect on many customer 's deposit account agreements, as these lines frequently serve as overdraft protection for the deposit accounts. That means that a customer who inadvertently overdraws their deposit account -- or who intentionally writes a check over the deposit account balance -- may be subject to overdraft fees or a dishonored item with a fee-without actually knowing that the line of credit account had been closed by WF without notice. The Customer Service person I spoke to was forced to agree that I had correctly interpreted the terms of the account change. 
Customers often do not know or understand the effect of the change of terms. As an attorney who wrote these terms for the former Wachovia bank, I do understand them and find the "" without notice '' clause a unfair and deceptive action. Customers can protect themselves by taking a minimum advance from the line of credit and paying it back on the next day. However, since the lines of credit were sold in part as overdraft protection lines, it is grossly unfair to allow the bank, particularly this bank with its recent customer service debacles, to take this action, The bank should absolutely provide a prior notice to shutting down the line so that customers can take appropriate action to protect their good credit standing on their deposit accounts. I can not determine if WF is taking this step to increase overdraft and returned item fees or if it is closing accounts without notice to control the access of employees to these lines of credit.

I received an email on XX/XX/2019 notifying me of the overdraft and that I was protected by Overdraft Protection however I had previously transferred the funds the day before.

Hello. This will be the third time I've emailed about the same issue. I have not received a response in writing, and I have made two phone calls about this issue. I'm including the original message I sent and the dates of the phone calls. I am HIGHLY unsatisfied with the level of service I am receiving from FedLoans as a student loan servicer. The representatives are unable to complete the plans we agree to on the phone. I will be looking into making formal complaints about your services and adequacy in overseeing loan repayment. If you are interested in addressing this grievance, please contact me. 

Hello, It looks like your records show I am late in making my XXXX payment. 

I received my first statement from you in the mail today, dated the XXXX of XXXX. My bill is due on the XXXX of each month, and my payment to XXXX has already processed. I am not late in my payment, nor could I have known where to send payment prior to your notification. I have documentation showing that my statement from XXXX called for a payment on my loan by the XXXX of XXXX and that the payment has been made. Please let me know if you need copies of these documents to correct the error on my account. I will not accept "" late '' status on my account, as I am current on my monthly payments. 

It also sounds like your records show I have not completed or been approved for the Income Driven Repayment plan in 2019. 

I re-applied for the Income Driven Repayment Plan in XXXX of this year, and received approval for the Income Based Repayment Plan in my XXXX inbox dated XX/XX/XXXX. I'd be happy to supply the documentation that shows my renewal has been approved for 2019, please let me know if you need this documentation as well. I will not accept the "" adjusted '' amount listed on my statement for the next billing cycle ( XXXX 2019 ), as it does not reflect that my loans have been recalculated under the Income Based Repayment Plan. 

I spoke with a representative on the phone earlier today, and was unable to clear up these errors on my account. I'm hopeful that this email will support action on my account. 

I expect these oversights to be righted before my next payment comes due. Please let me know if you need any additional information or documentation to support this correction. 

Thank you.

This is additional information to be added to my open complaint ( XXXX ). 

In the XXXX open complaint, I stated that I missed three payments ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in the year of XXXX due to COVID-19. 

I reported this to Wells Fargo during the early stage of COVID-19 when I was seeking assistance ( i.e. forbearance, loan modification, refinance ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid my mortgage off in full. Yet, Wells Fargo has placed serious delinquency on my XXXX credit report ( along with the other credit bureaus ). 

I found additional information from CFPB and DOJ copied at the bottom. I also attached this data as a pdf file. 

Based off this release, I feel that Wells Fargo has made a grave error by reporting to all three credit bureaus that I was delinquent. Wells Fargo has also reported to all three credit bureaus that Foreclosure started. 

Wells Fargo has caused GRAVE harm to me emotionally, mentally, and financially by placing adverse/negative information on my credit profiles. 

I was denied multiple times for loans ( i.e. refinance, loan modification, home equity, personal loans, etc. ) by Wells Fargo and other banks/creditors due to Wells Fargo 's actions. 

I humbly seek justice. 



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : XX/XX/XXXX MEDIA CONTACT : XXXX XXXX XXXX Tel : ( XXXX ) XXXX CFPB AND DOJ PUT LANDLORDS AND MORTGAGE SERVICERS ON NOTICE ABOUT SERVICEMEMBERS ' AND VETERANS RIGHTS Joint Letters Remind Landlords And Mortgage Servicers To Adhere To The CARES Act And Additional Legal Requirements Under The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act XXXX XXXXXXXX. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) issued two joint letters today regarding important legal housing protections for military families. One letter was sent to landlords and other housing providers regarding protections for military tenants. A second letter was sent to mortgage servicers regarding military borrowers who have already exited or will be exiting COVID-19 mortgage forbearance programs in the coming weeks and months. 

The letter to landlords and other housing providers reminds property owners of the important housing protections for military tenants, some of whom may have had to relocate or make other changes to their housing arrangements in response to the crisis. While military families enjoy the same legal protections and privileges afforded to all other homeowners and tenants, they also have additional housing protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ), which is enforceable by the DOJ and servicemembers themselves. 

The letter to mortgage servicers comes in response to complaints from military families and veterans on a range of potential mortgage servicing violations, including inaccurate credit reporting, misleading communications to borrowers, and required lump sum payments for reinstating their mortgage loans. These complaints are being reviewed for compliance by the CFPB with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act and other applicable requirements. 

The illegal foreclosures of military families in the last crisis was one of the financial industrys worst failures, said CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX. The CFPB will be closely watching mortgage servicers and will hold them accountable for illegal tactics perpetrated against military families. 

The Department of Justice takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard the rights of servicemembers and veterans, said Assistant Attorney General XXXX XXXX. While servicemembers carry the great burdens of this Nation, they should not have to worry that their sacrifices will result in economic harm to their families. Mortgage servicers and landlords must ensure that they are in full compliance with federal laws intended to protect servicemembers and their families during military service. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly 7.6 million homeowners entered forbearance. While the majority have resumed their regular mortgage payments, approximately 1.25 million borrowers many of whom are military borrowers remain in forbearance programs that will expire at the end of the year. Ensuring that mortgage servicers comply with their legal obligations is crucial, especially since a decade ago some large financial institutions illegally seized the homes of military families, sending their lives into a tailspin. These violations were a result of breakdowns in the mortgage servicing industry that were severe and widespread. The result was numerous settlements with regulators, including a {$180.00} XXXX settlement between DOJ and some of the countrys largest mortgage servicers. 

Servicemembers have several legal protections under the SCRA that are designed to enable them to devote their entire energy to the national defense. These include, for example, a prohibition on foreclosing on certain servicemembers mortgages without court orders, the ability for military families to terminate residential leases early, and without penalty, upon receipt of military orders, and a prohibition on evicting military families from their homes without court orders. In addition, under the CARES Act and Regulation X, servicemembers and veterans have the same protections available to all mortgage borrowers. These include, for example, streamlined COVID hardship forbearance options, requirements that mortgages receiving a COVID-19 hardship forbearance be reported as current to credit reporting agencies if the loan was current before entering forbearance under the CARES Act, and requirements in the Bureaus Regulations X and Z for treatment of delinquent borrowers and borrowers who have applied for loss mitigation. 

The CFPB and DOJ are calling on mortgage servicers and landlords to ensure that military homeowners and tenants are safeguarded during the pandemic and benefit equally from the Nations economic recovery.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MD,21054,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2022-08-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5895765

At the termination of the lease, the lessee has to return the vehicle and receives a lease termination statement, from the dealer where the vehicle is returned. The dealer reads the odometer, looks at the overall condition of the car, inputs the data into the system and generates a statement showing the amount to be paid in case of returning the car and a buyout proposal. 

In my case the value of the amount owed if returning the car was XXXX ( XXXX ) and the buyout was the residual value of the car. The dealer mentioned that any extra mileage fees will be waived. I opted for the return of the car and received a statement in writing showing a XXXX dollars owed to MBFS. 

Unbeknownst to me, the amounts were not accurate. MBFS assessed a {$5000.00} amount based on additional mileage and opted for reporting the amount to the Credit Bureaus as unpaid loan. This foreclosed any possibility for me to obtain another car lease for 7 years. 

The proper way for MBFS was to post the loan as paid in full, as showed in the document obtained at the end of the lease, and the {$5000.00}, as a collection item. The collection item would influence my overall credit, but it would allow me to obtain another car lease. 

I believe that adding the {$5000.00} at a later point is fraudulent, as the amount would have greatly influenced my decision to purchase the car rather than return it. 

By improperly reporting the item MBFS are trying to extort an amount that I believe it is not due to them. Rather than trying to adjudicate the matter in court, they are choosing to miss-report in an effort to unduly obtain the funds.

I have tried twice now to use the awarded companion certificate, but due to the excessive red tape around this product I have been unable to use the certificate. It is now set to expire in two weeks and I do not have any travel plans within that time. 
The first time I tried to use the certificate was the end of XX/XX/2019. I had a business trip to XXXX, TX and decided to bring my wife along and spend the weekend exploring. I had a flight credit to pay for my ticket from a previously cancelled flight ( also paid for with the Delta Amex card ), but I was told I could not use the companion certificate for my wife 's ticket because I was using the Delta credit for most of my ticket. I was told I have to purchase the full ticket with my Amex card in order to use the companion certificate. I did purchase the original flight using my Amex card, but unfortunately it was cancelled and I was left with the Delta flight credit vs a credit back to my Amex card. 
The second time I tried to use the companion certificate was on XX/XX/XXXX for a quick weekend trip with my wife to XXXX California. This was a last minute decision and we were wanting to leave that same weekend. I was told I could not use the companion certificate because the flights I was trying to book were too soon. Apparently there is a rule within the excessive red tape that Amex sets up that says companion certificates must be booked two weeks prior to the flight. I can understand why this rule would be in place, however, seats were still available on the flight when I was trying to book even though it was just days before the flight. Why shouldn't I be allowed to use the certificate that has been awarded when there are still seats available? 
My general complaint is that the marketing done by Amex and Delta around the companion certificate award is clearly unfair and deceptive. I pay a higher annual fee every year for this card because of the companion certificate benefit. Amex then creates so many restrictions and red tape around this certificate that it makes it almost impossible to use. I would not be surprised if there are many other customers in my same situation that have paid a higher annual fee and have had annual certificates go to waste because they were not used within the unrealistic rules set by Amex.

Just recently, I noticed Wells Fargo purchased a 3rd party insurance for my condo - going back to XXXX. This additional insurance coverage stayed on my condo from XXXX - XXXX ( three years ). This was fraudulent and baseless because there was never a lapse in my original/existing insurance coverage. Wells Fargo enlisted me in this additional insurance program for $ XXXX/year, so I am owed {$2100.00}. When I complained, Wells Fargo asked for me to provide insurance Declarations page for each year 's worth of coverage, and they would refund ME the {$2100.00}. They know they were wrong and refunded the money - however it went back into my Escrow account. All my conversations were then directed to the Escrow Department, who told me I will only get {$700.00} back. Again, it is illegal to force a consumer to purchase 3rd party insurance and I deserve my money back.

You'll never deal with the same person, they tell you that you need to talk to another department, and worse yet - anytime you are making progress in talking to someone, the phone gets cut off and you'll never hear from that person again.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was called by XXXX from the Wells Fargo Escrow Department ( who I had never spoke to before ) and he told me that I was entitled to a refund of {$700.00}. He thought he was giving me good news, and had no idea of my dealings with XXXX. When I mentioned my conversation with XXXX, XXXX said there is no case for my complaint on the insurance fraud or {$2100.00} being owed me. WELLS FARGO did absolutely NOTHING to investigate or solve my case. 

What's even worse, is that XXXX doesn't work in the Executive Office. That was a blatant lie and a form of deception. XXXX confirmed for me that the Executive Office is a higher level of management, and that ( if I'm talking to the Executive Office ), then he shouldn't have called me! After telling XXXX my whole story, he told me I am only due {$700.00}. Actually, he said he could DO ME A FAVOR and send me {$800.00}! 

The STORY gets WORSE! In my dealing with XXXX, he got to understand the ENTIRE SITUATION ( how the insurance department owed ME {$2100.00} ), he said he'd escalate to the Executive Office. BUT, we got cut off ( shocking )! and I never heard from XXXX again!! He had my phone number, and could have easily called me back. So to reconnect, I called XXXX 's phone number and extension multiple times. But again, Wells Fargo does this on purpose. They want me to go in circles and GIVE UP! XXXX 's number is ( XXXX x XXXX ), This gets WORSE! After speaking with the fifth person on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX directed me to XXXX XXXX, who is quite frankly the biggest scam artist of everyone. After 90-minutes on the phone, XXXX XXXX made the situation WORSE! Again, this is Wells Fargo 's deceitful approach to make the consumer give up. XXXX XXXX said she worked in the Executive Office, but she couldn't give me answers. What's worse, is she repeatedly said she didn't want to know what my issue was. In my disgust for customer service, she decided to create CASE # XXXX, which was a formal complaint about Wells Fargo 's customer service. I informed her I wanted CASE # XXXX handled, and not to waste our time on CASE # XXXX. BUT SHE INSISTED, CASE # XXXX would take priority! After wasting 2.5-hours with Wells Fargo - I have no other option but to file a formal complaint here. XXXX XXXX willfully and blatantly dragged my call on without providing ANY form of help or problem-solving techniques. I reiterated that she didn't know my problem, so it would be impossible for her to solve my problem. 

To add to this story is almost impossible, but it get 's worse. I asked XXXX XXXX for my case numbers, but she said her system was down and she'd place me on a brief hold for my case numbers. After a 5-minute hold, I got Case # XXXX She placed me on hold again to obtain CASE # XXXX, but after waiting 15-minutes on hold for this- I was cut off ( I KNOW, SHOCKING isn't it )! And no, XXXX XXXX did not call me back. I never heard from her again. 

This entire experience is incredible. They rob me of {$2100.00} and make no attempt to fix the situation. They lied to me on several occasions! And I have ZERO confidence in Wells Fargo going forward. This is ILLEGAL to wrongfully purchase insurance for someone. 

It's almost inhumane to deal with Wells Fargo.

I WAS GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WAS DUE TO START IN PA FOR HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUAL FAMILES THAT HAVE FACE EXTREME HARDSHIPS BECAUSE OR DUE TO COVID. 
I SIGNED UP FOR THIS EMAIL LIST FOR PAHAF IN XX/XX/XXXX. 
I WAS UPDATE VIA EMAIL OF WHEN THIS PROGRAM WILL LAUNCH. I WAS RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE SEARCHING FOR NEW EMPLOYMENT. THAT UNEMPLOYMENT STOP IN XX/XX/XXXX. THIS IS WHAT CAUSED ME TO FALL BEHIND WITH MY MORTGAGE. 

I RECEVED CONFIRMATION I BELIEVE IN XX/XX/XXXX THAT THEY WILL BE STARTING IN XX/XX/XXXX. ALSO IN XX/XX/XXXX I FOUND AND WAS OFFERED FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. 
I HAVE APPLIED FOR PAHAF. MY APPLICATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED ALL DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THIRD PARTY AUTHORIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SIGNED A SUBMITTED. 
TO THIS DAY AND AS OF JUST RECENTLY I WAS TOLD THAT PAHAF HAS BEEN WAITING FOR MIDWEST LOAN SERVICES TO SIGN OFF ON AN AGREEMENT. 
IM NOT SURE WHERE MY APPLICATION IS AT THIS POINT.

MY MORTGAGE IS CURRENTLY BEHIND AS OF TODAY {$7300.00}. I CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION OF MY APPLICATION AND IF THIS HAS BEEN APPROVED ACCEPTED AWARDED =PAYMENT. I FEEL LIKE THIS PROGRAM WAS SET UP TO HELP FAMILIES IN PA BUT ITS MAKING SITUATIONS WORST BECAUSE OF THIS LACK OR STAGANT MOVEMENT THEY ARE PUTTING FAMILIES LIKE MINE IN FORECLOSURE STATUS! IM WONDERING IS THIS THE GOAL? OR IS THE GOAL TO PROCESS MY APPLICATION GET THIS AGREEMENT SIGNED THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT THE ASSISTANCE FUNDS FOR THE PAST DUE AMOUNTS OF DELINQUENT PAYMENTS, AWARD THE MONEY, SEND THE PAYMENTS. 
SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH SO WHAT IS THE HOLD UP???? 
THIS IS THE EMAIL I SENT OUT LAST MONTH -- -- -- - XXXX XXXX XXXX Thu, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX XXXX  Hello XXXX, I received your message and I spoke to XXXX yesterday afternoon. I want to start by saying this is more than beyond Unfortunate ( to say the least ). I am in the same situation as I have been patiently waiting for this process to be completed for months now. And I am in a worse situation than I was in XXXX and XXXX. Everyone that I have spoken to from PAHAF is aware of this. 
I have done everything asked of me to do per my participation and applying for assistance with PA HAF. 
I would like to know why this was not caught ( XXXX ) non-participation with PA HAF in the beginning stages of this application process? 
It makes no sense and is Grossly Negligent to me that I am just literally finding out as of XX/XX/XXXX from MIDWEST LOAN services- servicing provider for XXXX that they ( XXXX ) is not participating. And I will continue to do what I can to shed light on XXXX non-participation. 
However, it seems I was not properly notified or made aware of all of this in a timely manner from PAHAF- MIDWEST LOAN- XXXX. 

I am behind on my mortgage 5 months with this current month of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX {$1000.00} all due in total as of today {$6200.00}. It would have only been 3 months but due to MIDWEST not accepting any more payment from me since XX/XX/XXXX i am now a total of 5 months. 
I was trying to pay my mortgage payment each month starting XXXX XXXX once I obtained employment for the purpose of not falling further behind. 
However, I was not able to make the payment independently because I have been in collections. I was told by XXXX XXXX ( who works with Midwest Lost Mitigation or Collections dept. ) who was working with me to call her each month so that she will process my payments. That stopped in XX/XX/XXXX. I explain all of that to say I have been doing what I can to not fall further behind as I'm waiting for the process of approval and award / payment from PAHAF. Really ( at this point ) I want help with saving my home! This is MY and My Family home, me and my children! 
I am not getting any more information to help me with getting my mortgage payments current! 
I don't want to believe that this program was created to "" NOT '' help families like mine. Families through no fault of our own that have been Financially affected and forced to deal with this PANDEMIC! 
I want to know what are the next steps from here? 
How and ( if any ) what options do I have to get assistance now to catch up on my past due mortgage payments? 
Are there any other NON profit organizations that PAHAF works with that may be a liason to XXXX so that I can get the payment to them for my mortgage? 
Will anyone assist me with this? 
Is PAHAF working on solutions to find another way to help me? 
Do I or Should I reach out to XXXX XXXX directly? 
Do I need to reach out to the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY  and Pennsylvania State treasury? 
I refuse to do nothing and I have not been given any options from anyone. 

I am currently waiting for XXXX to get back to me, as she PROMISED ( yesterday afternoon ) she will contact me this morning. I have left XXXX a text message ( not sure if she has received it ). 
I am available all day via phone XXXX and text, email XXXX.

These transfers, which resulted in a {$12.00} charge to my credit card was not done by me. They were either done by an employee within the Wells Fargo organization or done as the result of an error on the part of Wells Fargo 's banking systems, which happens often with this financial institution. However, they are now trying to force me to be responsible for paying these unauthorized charges ( fees ) in the amount of {$12.00} which is indeed fraudulent in nature. I have spoken to several representatives since XX/XX/2019 and to no avail have not gotten any satisfaction. They actually refunded half of the fraudulent fees, but left the remaining {$12.00} charged to my card. How is it that they would refund half of the unauthorized charges/fees, but leave the other half on my card? It doesn't make sense and no one within their organization can answer that question. They refuse to allow me to dispute this charge online via my portal so as to continue to assess fees to the card because I refuse to pay their fraudulent charges. 

I never authorized Wells Fargo to use a credit card account as a line of protection for any other accounts I've had with them over the years. This was something Wells Fargo did on their own. I never gave them permission to use this card for that purpose, however, they've done it and that in itself is fraudulent. For this reason, as well as my dissatisfaction with this bank for allowing this problem to go unresolved for 3 months, and other issues, I have closed ALL of my accounts. I believe their inaction in handling this matter is retaliation for me doing so. They are a scam and defraud customers to generate fee income on their products and services. I have been trying to get this issue of {$12.00} resolved since XX/XX/2019, and yet, I get nothing but the run-around with this institution. As a consumer, I will not be forced to pay for unauthorized charges or fees to a credit card or deposit account. For a bank like Wells Fargo to continue such an issue over {$12.00} is ridiculous.

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I called Paypal in an attempt to resolve the issue. The Paypal call center agreed to correct the currency but refused to undo the claim, on the grounds that it is a small amount and it will die itself. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification from XXXX that my reservation was cancelled because of a dispute with Paypal. Email attached in Exhibit XXXX. I subsequently received a separate notification from Paypal that my dispute for {$0.00} was approved Exhibit XXXX. However, I was not refunded the full amount of the reservation the remaining {$2300.00}. 
Upon receiving notification of cancellation but no refund of the 99.997 % of the purchase price, I attempted to open a new claim with Paypal for the remaining {$2300.00}. However, the Paypal website prevented me from doing so as a claim on the same transaction was already approved. 
After multiple futile attempts to have Paypal reopen the claim through its website, I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Record of our correspondence attached in Exhibit XXXX. XXXX stated that I should contact Paypal as funds had been returned to Paypal, with transaction ID XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Paypal. Paypal opened a new claim, however, it was denied on XX/XX/XXXX denial attached in Exhibit XXXX. Paypal motivated its denial on the grounds that the item or service was delivered to you, according to Paypal records. Nonetheless, the reservation continued to be clearly cancelled per XXXX records ( screenshot from XXXX website in Exhibit XXXX, incremental to cancellation email in Exhibit XXXX ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried once again to call XXXX, who once again confirmed that a full refund was provided to Paypal ( see XX/XX/XXXX message in Exhibit XXXX ). I once again called Paypal, which once again refused to provide the refund. Record of message sent from Paypal attached in Exhibit XXXX. I have received no further communications from Paypal. 
In sum, Paypal XXXX wilfully misled me as to payment currency, XXXX caused a cancellation of my reservation with XXXX, XXXX refused to consider compelling evidence of non-delivery of service to me, and XXXX engaged in unjust enrichment by refusing to return to me funds that were refunded to Paypal by XXXX, as confirmed in writing by XXXX",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",NY,10003,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5754460

The merchant is part of a global network of Cybercrime known as the binary option and falsified trading scam. I have accessed the Internet-based platform of the Merchant available under XXXX XXXX To the best of our knowledge, the Merchant did not provide a contract ; however, the terms and conditions contained on the site are intended to govern the relationship and responsibilities of the parties. Therefore, all information on the website is relevant for determination of the services and the rights and obligations of the parties. The Merchant claimed to be a financial services provider dealing with regulated financial products, such as CFDs, indices, binary options, commodities etc. In addition, the officers and employees of the Merchant are also presented as experienced brokers ( a designation that requires licensing ). Evidently, it is advertising and promoting itself as a provider of financial services and is trying to influence third parties decisions to undertake financial commitments and to invest in the offered financial products based upon the information provided by the Merchant on its website. All those activities require the Merchant to possess the required licensing. The website of the Merchant contains clear statements that its team consists of professional brokers. Persons claiming to be such licensed brokers apparently contacted third parties and communicated with them the possibility of making an investment, which is strictly prohibited by the law if there is a lack of the respective license. Only a licensed broker can contact persons with the intention to assist them regarding where and how to invest their money. To be able to act as an investment intermediary, or broker, or similar i.e., to have the capacity to offer financial advice and to provide access to regulated financial products to third parties one must be registered with the relevant supervisory authorities. It is the common rule that financial products such as CFDs, indices, binary options, stocks and commodities exists, are regulated, not only in the XXXX, in which the Merchant claims to be located, but also in most of the rest of the world, including in United States ( where our client resides and where your money services business is registered ). However, the Merchant is NOT licensed to offer regulated financial products nor to provide financial advice to third parties such as our client. There are warnings from Government Regulatory Authorities for operating and providing financial services without having the proper required licensing. The Merchant claimed to have the ability to trade regulated financial products. In truth, the merchant provides a fictitious and malicious software which does not execute any trades and is not connected to any recognized exchanges. It is manipulated by the merchant to exhibit its own desired figures. The merchant has left a trail of victims who have fallen for a sophisticated and well-crafted scam and that have lost their entire life savings.

In XX/XX/XXXX, after calling again to ask why my payment had not posted, a customer service rep confirmed that FedLoan had the payment from XX/XX/XXXX ( processed in XX/XX/XXXX ) but it was unapplied to any month and therefore was not counted as a payment. She assured me that she would fix this. I made additional attempts to resolve this issue in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I had a lawyer attempt to resolve the issue. 

This unapplied payment and the resulting "" late '' payments '' have STILL not been corrected. I have made numerous attempts to resolve this with FedLoan over the past year and a half, but no change is ever made. I finally made a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX to bring the account current, as I was worried the constant late status of my payments would negatively affect me. I have now received a notice that one of my loans is no longer eligible for the special grant/forgiveness program offered through my college due to late payment, which is upsetting because I have not missed any payments there is just a payment that has been misapplied for over a year, and FedLoan appears incapable of rectifying the issue. Also upsetting is that I was assured several times that my eligibility for PSLF would NOT be affected ; however, I am now discovering that is not the case because qualifying payments can not be made more than 15 days late. I have made every payment on time or early, but because FedLoan did not apply my XX/XX/XXXX payment, every subsequent payment through XX/XX/XXXX was marked as late. Given that a year and half is a long time to resolve an issue of how to apply a payment, and as evidenced by their lack of action even after being contacted by legal aid, at this point I can only assume that FedLoan is unwilling to properly handle my loan and does not care how their actions have impacted me.",,AES/PHEAA,TX,79414,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3299393
20570,2019-07-10,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"I received an email notification from Huntington National Bank on XX/XX/2019 indicating that my credit limit on my credit card was being decreased. The email provided no further explanation, other than I would "" receive a notice with more information by mail in the next few days. '' I have yet to receive said notice in the mail. 

I checked my account online and indeed confirmed my credit limit was reduced from {$24000.00} to {$21000.00}. The account has a {$0.00} balance. 

When I called to inquire, the representative informed me the change in credit limit was due to an evaluation of my FICO score, credit history, and relationship with the bank. I requested the limit be restored and was denied. I was also told it could not be re-evaluated for 6 months. Fearing that something was wrong with my credit report, I checked it immediately. 

My FICO score is XXXX. My credit summary shows I'm currently using only 4 % of my available credit, of which {$110000.00} is currently available. There was no unusual activity on my credit report. No changes or discrepancies. XXXX missed/late payments. Ever. My annual income of {$200000.00} remains unchanged, and I have weekly deposits directed into separate checking and savings accounts with Huntington National Bank. 

So, I have been unable to discern any other valid reason for the reduction in credit on the account, other than the card has a {$0.00} balance and I haven't used it for a purchase in at least 6 months. 

I called back a second time to dispute the reduction in credit limit and request a restoration to my original credit limit of {$24000.00}. I was again denied, and was dismissed by both the initial representative and subsequently, her manager, to whom I was transferred. The manager also refused to provide a copy of the bank 's decision criteria when requested.

I believe the decision to reduce my credit limit was unfounded, arbitrary and unfair on the part of Huntington National Bank.

20572,2022-08-14,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"To whom this may concern, I opened a Discover It card that requires a security deposit. I was ill-advised this is something I should do to establish credit when it was entirely unnecessary as my credit score was in good standing at the time of application with Discover on XX/XX/XXXX. It appears the account was closed yesterday after telling Discover almost daily over the phone to close it since Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. On the XXXX, I was told the case was still pending so I said great, go ahead and deny it out and close it as I do not want the card and refund my {$2200.00} security deposit as quickly as humanly possible by crediting it back to my bank checking account. 

Here is what has happened since I made that request. I was told by two employees in the Arizona Office that we have to actually go ahead and finalize and approve your card before we can close it. I was baffled and told them why they cant just deny the application per my request. Neither gave me an answer. I was then told that I would receive an email that takes 24 hours to receive which sounded odd to me because every email Ive ever sent or received in my life happened instantly. Anyway, by mid day Monday the 24 hour email from Saturday had not arrived. Discover also did not provide me a case number or any other kind of communication that the case was closed. I was told on Saturday the XXXX that there are case notes here sir documenting everything. I was highly dissatisfied after a couple hours on the phone with both of them. 

On Monday, XXXX, I spoke to a Delaware Discover employee who was blatantly rude. She refused to transfer me to the correct department for a security deposit refund. She also claimed she couldnt send the 24 hour email but was putting a note in the system for someone to send another one to take 24 hours. She was adamant it was sent despite me telling her after confirming that they sent it to the correct email address that I had not received it. 

I spoke again with Discover on Tuesday and was told by an Ohio supervisor XXXX XXXX XXXX that she had sent another email while I was on the line to take 24 hours. I finally exploded on the phone and was completely irate yesterday and spent 2 hours and 45 minutes transferred to at least five different employees. The last employee had no answer and simply stated that emails can take 24 or 48 hours to receive. When I caught him changing the number of hours and how I still didnt have any email six days after starting all of this last Saturday he had no answer. 

Here is the present status of the case. I received a letter in the mail today that the case is closed. They sent me an approval letter yesterday with the card which I have cut up for security of course. That approval letter should never have been sent because not only did I want it closed the case was incomplete. I never provided necessary identity requested by Discover to XXXX. I never submitted my drivers license or income verification for the card that they requested to verify my identity. Discover had no answer for this when asked. 

I do not know or trust that Discover will refund all of my {$2200.00} security deposit. Credit cards come with a lot of fees and fine print. Nobody said they would charge me anything since the card was never activated let alone used. Their word on the phone does not mean anything. I am still receiving reminder emails from XXXX for the fourth consecutive day today so I unsubscribed today after telling them to stop as I did not go through with the card.

If I receive one cent less than the full security deposit I want to know if this agency can help me and get involved in the matter. If I should also contact another agency such as a state attorney generals office in which Discover is headquartered, please let me know if that is the more appropriate action. 

Discover also has lied about refund dates for my security deposit. Last Saturday the XXXX I spoke to in Arizona ( who I have come to find out dont even process those returns- they occur through the Ohio office ) said I would get it by this Tuesday or Wednesday ( the XXXX or XXXX ). I am now forecasted to receive it XX/XX/XXXX which they are calling expedited service and a favor to me. They are also sending the check out to my house and not returning it directly to my checking account- which was the manner in which it was withdrawn. The check will also come through the Postal Service despite my pleading for it to come through a carrier like XXXX or XXXX. However, if a person uses this card and gets their deposit returned after 6 months of good use, they allow the customer to receive the deposit back in the manner the customer prefers. This does not seem appropriate granted how shady Discover was in pushing through this card to me when the case was incomplete and I also requested denial/closure when it was still pending and they could have readily done that by simply pushing a button. 

At the moment I have about 6-8 hours invested and hope I will receive full repayment of my {$2200.00} security deposit. I know it may seem that I am filing a complaint too soon as the XXXX has not arrived yet but I do not want to wait as Discover has committed several unethical or illegal practices to warrant me writing this in my mind. They should not be giving ordinary Americans this kind of treatment, especially when they are one of the largest corporations in the US and I have done absolutely nothing wrong on my part. 

Thank you so much for your time in reading this. Hopefully I will receive full payment no later than the XXXX of XXXX as promised by Discover and will not need to contact this agency any further. If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me.

KOHLS/CAPITALONE has the obligation to correct action. On XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB released Circular XXXX  to reiterate creditors adverse action notice requirements under ECOA.

Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation. Under 15 USC 1666B Grace period- If an open end consumer credit plan provides a time period within which an obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring an additional finance charge, such additional finance charge may not be imposed with respect to such portion of the credit extended for the billing cycle of which such period is a part, unless a statement which includes the amount upon which the finance charge for the period is based was mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the date specified in the statement by which payment must be made in order to avoid imposition of that finance charge.

I don't know maybe coercion, extortion, wanting me to be quiet while I'm being discriminated against by them?

THE DEBT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAYED BY THE UNITED STATES that's what that Federal Law is clearly stating so KOHLS/CAPITALONE CAN NOT use the excuse "" the consumers lack of timely payments '' as reasoning to close my account.

To my horror I see that my account is negative over {$54.00} when it should have at least {$6.00} after a scheduled $ XXXX deposit and several other deposits to cover multiple pending debits that weren't supposed to go through until today and tomorrow. 
Upon checking the transactions I see where the bank processed multiple debits in the evening of the XXXX just after my deposits were made on the XXXX, which is highly peculiar. Normally I don't see transactions start to post until sometime around midnight but these were posted several hours before and just after my deposits. A scheduled $ XXXX XXXX  deposit to cover these charges that otherwise wouldn't have or shouldn't have posted until the XXXX ( today ) was posted to the account as scheduled after all of those debits were made against my account. They scheduled all debits before any deposits or credits which made the account negative long enough for their system to charge two {$30.00} NSF fees for the two debits that weren't covered by all of the cash deposits I made on the XXXX. 
This is absolutely not fair and disgusting. I am sickened by this. The two {$30.00} fees are for timing, no human interaction or involvement, for debits that were made to charge through to my account earlier than expected just before a posting deposit that was made to cover them came through. 
When I logged into my account yesterday evening the account was still positive which means that these were timed in a way that put them hours apart instead of on the same day. I wholeheartedly and absolutely disagree that I owe a bank {$60.00} for what is essentially a computer function timing issue with no work or involvement otherwise. 
I have a very tragic and stressful life and absolutely did not need this additional burden involving what is essentially my current primary account. 
If the fees were reversed it would bring the account positive $ XXXX and if they were not then it would unfortunately have to stay negative and would probably escalate to collections and add further damage where it is not due. Even worse there is another {$20.00} charge pending and I was about to deposit $ XXXX in addition to the $ XXXX that should already be in the account today to cover that charge for tomorrow or Thursday. Because the account is negative and I currently do not have enough to cover the negative balance that pending charge is going to result in yet another NSF FEE because the bank didn't want to work with me and fix the issue because they very clearly do not care. After this the account will be over {$100.00} negative and I definitely will not be able to recover it then. 
I deserve better than to be treated like this, especially when I am clearly trying more than my best to keep this from really getting out of hand! 
Do you not see that if you don't help me fix this issue now that we'll both be out of more because of how it escalates!?! The charge off balance will be well over {$100.00} plus that'll be irrecoverable and you'll have to have collections staff dedicate time harassing me with letters and calls a few months from now when this absolutely doesn't have to happen and could be fixed quickly now by reversing these 2 fees, especially since it is more than obvious that I was doing everything I could keep this from happening!!",,BANK OF HAWAII CORPORATION,HI,96815,,Consent provided,Web,2022-08-23,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,5910111

By now, I very well know that I wont get a single penny back from you guys but I wont let you guys off the hook easily. Reason being you guys are so manipulative since the start of the loan process and even now after 3 complaints, you guys are still doing what you are best at i.e., to manipulate the numbers. 

I am not XXXX, the first time you explained the tax credits I got it at that time only and never asked any questions regarding that. And now when you told me that {$500.00} was adjusted against the initial deposit, I wont ask a question on that also. But that {$1000.00} amount which you are telling me is the estimated lenders title policy adjustment credit that is nothing but a blatant lie. In the attached initial estimate, there was no such amount mentioned then how did you come up with that number. There is one amount of owners title policy of {$620.00} but the credit of that is already applied in the estimate which is not a part of adjustments and credits. 

I am saying it again that I know it very well that I wont get a single penny back from you guys because you guys are only interested in coming up with a new story everytime and repeating the same things again and again. If you would have read my complaint every time, you would have not explained the tax credit everytime as I never asked that question except the first complaint. This lenders title policy adjustment was never mentioned in the first 2 complaints and now you floated this term in 3rd complaint. So all I want to know now is what was the calculation logic behind that {$1000.00} amount.",,"Rocket Mortgage, LLC",OH,43035,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3317604

Im putting a claim again Sallie Mae/Navient/NavRefi XXXX I have two articles that found not only by CFPB but XXXX. CFPB as come to an settlement with NAVIENT. I too have been a victim of their practices and here is how. 

I left XXXX XXXX for the Visual Arts back in XX/XX/XXXX. My loans started on XX/XX/XXXX. I was only working part time and was looking for full time work. I found a temporary full time job with XXXX XXXX A third party administrator. My last day was on XX/XX/XXXX. I was out of work from XXXX to XXXX where I found a full time job. With the same company. I was making a little above minimum wage. 

I called Sallie Mae at the time tried to get my 5 loan accounts payments lowered. I was given the options of Forbearances or deferment. No income driven repayment options were suggested. I took these options over the course of several years. I couldnt go in defult, because my parents names were attached to my loans as well. This made my loans bloom into payments of XXXX per month. Because of the capitalization interest that came with it and the fees to each loan just for saying yes, i want a forbearances. 

Also, I have all my late document that will show that Navient failed to allocate payments to my loan accounts. There examples of paying with in the month and still getting late fee charges. Examples of payment reversals and adjustments. Which added up to more Mooney for them. 

XXXX, my husband lost his job and again tried to call Sallie Mae to lower my payments and wasnt able to help me. I was steered heat again in to forbearances and or deferments. This is the reason why for all my late payments. Please see attachments. I was trying to steel from XXXX to pay XXXX. With two car payments rent and normal bills Sallie Mae/Navient/NavRefi has put my family in financial hardships for over 15 years. 

I have been swindled into paying more than my fair share on this loan. With the loan capitalization was added after getting out of an forbearances or deferment. See that Navient was digging me into a financial hole that i coulnt see myself out. 

Not only the financial hardships aspect, my husband and I weren't able to buy a home nor raise a family of our own. That has put a mental, physical and emotional toll on us that i can never get those years back. That has made a ripple effects on my parents as well has my mother-in-law. 

Fast forwarding to XXXX. I wanted to get my parents off my collage loans with Navient as co-signers. I called navient to see what I could do and my only option was to make so many payments consistently, then I could get my co-signers off my loans. Spoiler alert, that wasnt going to happen. I couldnt afford my payments. Yet again another road block. 

Then came late XX/XX/XXXX, where i found a flyer stating that i could consolidate my loans, though NavRefi. NAVIENT is co-owner with NavRefi. I figured that they offered me to be able to consolidate my loans and get my parents off as co-signers. I thought this would be perfect so I could get my college loans under PSLF and be done. Wrong. I wasnt able to do this because my collage loans are private entity. Which found out that i couldnt change them over to PSLF. 

Please see all attachments to this claim. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

USAAs policy reads, Payments are issued electronically when possible, which takes 1 to 2 business days to process. For billers that don't accept electronic payments, a paper check is mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, which  takes about four days for delivery. XXXX continues to accept electronic payments, so why would USAA decide to mail checks in lieu of electronic payments when their policy states otherwise? The USAA representative initially said that XXXX was to blame suggesting they take longer to process checks once received. He is incorrect. XXXX processes payments on the same day the payments are received. The USAA representative also told me that USAA does not reimburse customers for the late fees they incur. Clearly, USAAs policy states otherwise. If the payment doesn't post on time, we'll cover up to {$50.00} in late fees, penalties or related finance charges. Over the course of two years, I incurred more than {$50.00} in late fees and interest.

20654,2022-06-08,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,,"I have a loan for my security equipment through this company. Back in XXXX, the card that I had my recurring payments coming from was shut off because XXXX changed to XXXX. My payment did not go through. I got an email that the payment didn't go through and I needed to make the payment. I went online to make the payment on XX/XX/22 of {$40.00} for my XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, Instead of the payment being {$40.00} they took out {$81.00} with the recurring payment. That was two payments instead of one. I called and informed that now in XXXX I have made 3 payments and to change it so it does not make a payment out in XXXX. The agent I first talked to told me that the system just shows it as an extra payment if you make a payment before the due date. I informed that I was making the payment that I was told that I owed. Your system should have recognized that and only taken out the amount monthly amount. She said they had no way of changing that and I needed to call my bank to dispute the charge. I told her I did not want to be on auto-pay and she informed me that could not be changed either. 

I requested to speak with a manager and stated there was no manager available and placed a request for a manager to call back. No manager called me back and the payment of {$40.00} came out anyway. Now, that is XXXX payments made between XXXX and XXXX. I called back asking for a manager, again I am told a manager is not available and the same excuse of an extra payment. I explained again that I was not making an extra payment and that I needed this corrected and to be taken off of auto-pay. The other rep informed me that I had to go to XXXX to change the auto pay. I called them and they said they have nothing to do with the payment for the equipment loan. 

This time the rep stated he was putting in a complaint and I would hear back from a manager. Again, a manager does not call but I receive a credit to the card. I called again and asked what happen and they said the payment was reversed but no you are past due and owe for XXXX. I said I do not, that is the whole reason the payment was reversed because you all are taking too much money out. The account needs to be adjusted to show its current. Again, they do not know how to do it and said they would request for a manager to contact me. I still do not hear from a manager until almost two weeks later and she left me a message on my phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I tried calling back and was not able to reach her. I requested another call back from a manager because the account was still saying I was past due and now I am getting collection calls about the balance. I spoke with a collection rep on XX/XX/XXXX and she stated that it should not be passed due after looking at the amount I paid and putting in a complaint to have it fixed. I still don't receive a call from a manager. I keep getting notices that my account is past due and another rep contacts me on XXXX asking about my payment. I explain everything to her again and state a manager has still not contacted me back. She states she is putting in an escalation ticket and that manager will be calling me back that day. Another day goes by with no call. They take out {$81.00} on XXXX and then say they are taking out another {$81.00} on XXXX. When the amount authorized is {$40.00}. I have advised my bank to block my card and dispute the charges and no one will call me to fix this problem.

With the job that I have, this amount was manageable for me to get paid in a considerable time. Transworld came back with counter offer with almost {$5500.00} in which they told me I'd have to pay in a month.

I was able to make a payment of {$500.00} on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, but was told that I only had a few days to come up with the rest. I told them that this would be impossible for me to do, but they insisted that I figure it out.

I also explained that I was trying to buy a home for my family, but she did not seem to care about anything regarding my goals She also exclaimed that I would not be eligible for another settlement offer for another 6 months if I didn't pay the remaining balance of the settlement and they I was not allowed to put in for a settlement around tax season so that I would not have an opportunity to pay the account of using any tax refunds which is terrible.

With that, I am seeking help urgently from you, as I am feeling helpless at this very moment. 

Most of the depositors, including myself have been misled in some way and thinking if there are any legal recourses in returning back the deposits, for myself or others who are depending heavily on the deposits to get our family and life going in the coming months. 

In the CEOAs weekly - Ask Me Anything meeting, we had been consistently communicated and made to believe our assets deposited in Celsius are safe as we were told those deposited assets are loaned out to big institutional investors, that was backed with over-collateralized assets while we can also withdraw our funds in full anytime. By that understanding, therefore majority of the depositors, including myself had been signed up. In fact, I placed all the fiat-term deposits into Celsius especially when XXXX said XXXX numerous times in XXXX how Celsius is even safer than a bank.

20715,2022-08-06,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"Hi, this is a follow-up to the CFPB complaint concerning Upgrade. 


XXXX. Per the description provided, "" Upgrade is a financial technology company, not a bank. We work with banks and other financial institutions to offer financial products to consumers. '' XXXX. Financial technology company, to my knowledge, does not lend money, nor do they have the authority to keep personal data. The use and reporting to my credit are not within federal or state privacy laws for data collection. 

XXXX. Upgrade has damaged my credit, without authority. They will correct my credit immediately. 

XXXX. "" Charge off '' is not a defined term in this loan agreement. 

XXXX. There are 2 borrower agreements. Both have all payments going to XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Upgrade. The 2nd loan agreement is dated XX/XX/XXXX, which is an incorrect date. The 1st loan agreement states that my interest rate is 22.82 % with a loan amount of {$20000.00}. Both truths in lending statements show the amount financed is {$18000.00} with an interest rate of 26.99 %. Neither truth in lending mentions Upgrade. The borrower agreement states it will not share information outside of XXXX XXXX XXXX Upgrade has retained all of my information and has severely damaged my credit. The borrower agreement states that interest is calculated based on 365 days in a year, defining the payments being due on the last day of the month. It also goes over the definition of the last day of the month. It states the last payment is {$560.00}. The truth in lending states that the loan is 60 months, to be paid off on XX/XX/XXXX and a start date of XX/XX/XXXX. The last date of the month in XXXX of XXXX is the XXXX. The borrower agreements contradict each other. One states that the jurisdiction is XXXX XXXX, and one states it's XXXX XXXX  The origination fee is {$1600.00}, which is defined as prepaid interest. This would not add up based on 22.82 % or 26.99 %. The {$1600.00} is part of the loan, and again, it's not in the truth in lending. The borrower agreements show {$200000.00}. 

XXXX. I would like copies of the cashed checks that were cut or ACH confirmations in funding the loan. Also copies of agreements with my signature and a loan officer 's signature. I do not have that. It states that a XXXX and XXXX were paid for me, the information only shows they paid a XXXX 

Needless to say, this is not a valid contract. When I log in to Upgrade 's site, it tells me my credit score is XXXX. The same defined XXXX version with a credit bureaus website is XXXX. It appears they are falsely reporting the status. Next to the score reported by Upgrade ( XXXX XXXX ) is a button to get started getting a credit card through them. 

I will no longer be responsible for this debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX or Upgrade Inc. due to a breach of contract. The contract was deceiving in the information as stated above. I am submitting this through the CFPB. With a copy to XXXX to begin the reporting. XXXX is listed as the credit scoring agency.

'' Upon calling this number and providing the file number to the woman who answered the phone, I was transferred to another woman who said she was Attorney XXXX XXXX at ext. XXXX. She stated there was a lien against my property and that the original debt was from Chase Bank/Washington Mutual . She would not provide me ANY details of the lien case number or her information. She stated she did not have to provide me with anything and would not provide it until the debt was paid. She said I owed {$11000.00}, but that I could be offered a hardship settlement. I told her I would need that. She put me on hold and then came back and said she would be able to clear the debt for {$5700.00}. I asked for time to see if I could get that kind of money and she was very aggressive stating that if I dont want to pay that is fine then they will just lien my home. I told her I never said I wasnt going to pay it, I just needed like 30 minutes to see if I could raise that kind of money. She said that was fine and told me to call back to pay otherwise the lien would remain. I then asked how they were going to remove the lien if I paid and she said well, the lien hasnt yet been filed, but we will send to the district attorney 's office if you dont pay. I asked for an email to validate the debt and she again stated that she does not have to provide me anything until the debt is paid. 

In reviewing the information she provided the phone number comes back to an XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL. I did a XXXX  search for the company XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and there is no website.

When I called back to find out if the email was sent, I was told the girl who handles it is not in at the moment, but would send it as soon as she is in. Additionally, they promised a XXXX balance letter will be overnighted to me and supposedly, that will not happen until Monday. 

I am reporting because I believe the time for filing on this charged off debt was uncollectible, as the statute of limitations has expired because the debt was from around XXXX. Additionally, they impersonated a law office and lawyer to which there is no evidence that either the business or attorney even exist.

Disputed through XXXX. Same thing deleted from account and the collection agency added it right back. 
I did follow up with each, deleted by both credit reporting agencies and added back a few days later. 
My reason for the dispute is because I was never notified of a collection company. I found it by checking my credit report. Through the dispute I found it to be hospital bills for several XXXX and hospital stay for XXXX 2 days. 
Then disputed the amount claimed by collections that I owed. 

The dispute was for the collections amount of {$1200.00}. Last reported XX/XX/2019 Then the same collections company added another collection for {$1100.00} Last reported XXXX XXXX same date. 
Now State Collection Service says I owe them a total of {$2400.00} I have been paying XXXX, the hospital regularly every month and the balance owed is {$900.00} not the {$2400.00}. Apparently the collection service is going to try to get me to pay them a second time for the hospital services.

So my wife kept track of what she paid leaving todays balance of {$900.00}. When I found out there was collections reported I called the Hospital to ask if they sold the account to State collections or if state was acting as a collection resource on their behalf. The Hospital refused to answer that question which makes me even more nervous because I might have to pay the same bill twice. We used checks to pay them so proof of payments can be gotten from the bank. The amount starting was {$2900.00}. The difference is the payments we made to XXXX in the 90 days before they sent the balance to State collections. The hospital said that the turn all bills owed after 90 days to collections. They said they sent a contract for payments to be made monthly which we never received. But, we made payments because we knew we owed them even without statements.

MT Bank contacted me on XXXX XXXX and informed me they are now in the process of foreclosing on the home, stating I am in default for unpaid monthly payments. This is false- the Bank has paused the required monthly payments due to being in the DIL process- they are threatening to foreclose my home without my knowledge and without informing me of issues in the DIL process. 

The DIL process has taken over a year since the application was submitted. The Bank has continuously dragged the process out, taking 2-3 months to send notary documents to an incorrect address several times, providing the wrong home address to the security company they hired to change the locks, and processing legal paperwork through their lawyers. I was informed in XXXX that the notary documents were received, and the last step was a final title check - which still has not been performed to close out the process. The Bank has failed to provide transparency or continuity in its statements about the process. 

Due to the lengthy time MT Bank has taken, the home has now been compromised, and my financial struggles have no defined end. On XX/XX/XXXX, my next-door neighbor informed me that the property was broken into and trashed. The neighbors, who are physically connected to the townhome, have repeatedly called the cops about squatters on the property and are concerned for their familys safety. They are outraged that the Bank has not finalized this process, causing undue XXXX and worry about the safety of their children. I notified MT Bank on XX/XX/XXXX with the Police Report Case Number and received no feedback, response, or acknowledgment. 

Their delay in closing out the DIL process has forced me to pay unnecessary utility costs, hundreds of dollars over the year, only made worse by the squatters who had broken into the home. They turned all the utilities back on and trashed the house. MT Bank continues to call me to cross-examine me about the home 's condition as part of their "" process '' without finalizing the DIL in an acceptable timeframe, and despite the information I have repeatedly provided over the year. 

The Bank has, in writing, held me to pay utility and insurance costs and accept responsibility for the maintenance of the home, which I have not had physical access to since they hired XXXX XXXX to change the locks and secure the property. I can not even have my insurance company enter the home to accurately assess the damages ( which I should not be held responsible for as I have no physical access to the house ). The neighbors informed me that XXXX XXXX was well aware of the squatters and made no further attempts to inform interested stakeholders or secure the home appropriately. 

This is causing increased and unnecessary risk to the protection of the home, the neighborhood, and my financial costs- which I should no longer be obligated to since the Bank and XXXX XXXX have set the conditions for increased risk.

Afraid to apply to unknown sites, I applied on the primary AMEX website because I already had an account and wanted to avoid phishing of personal information from unknown sites.

20747,2022-05-25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"Hello, Someone fraudulently opened a checking account with USAA using my name/information. I found out because in mid XXXX I received a debit card from USAA that I never requested, nor should be able to receive since I'm not a service member nor have I ever been. I contacted them and after multiple calls, days, and hours of my time they finally were able to deduce that the account was fraud and that they would proceed to close it. I asked that once the account was closed to please send me a physical/mailed confirmation that the account was closed, both for my records and peace of mind. I believe that sending out a letter stating that an account has been closed is common practice with banks, or at least it has been in my experience. I also feel like given the fraud situation this is something that should be provided to the person affected without hesitation. 

A few days ago ( late XXXX ), I received a bank statement from USAA about this fraudulent account. This was worrisome, so I decided to call them to figure out why I was receiving a bank statement from them, and also why I had never received a mailed confirmation of the account being closed like I had requested. They then proceeded to ask me for all my personal information ( name, address, social security number ), to which I told them that I would be happy to give them my name and address but I didn't feel comfortable sharing my social security number because of the exact security issue that I was dealing with them about. I them proceeded to be told that I could not be "" authenticated '' and was hung up on. 

I then proceeded to call back and finally got someone on the phone that would help me to some degree. The person asked for my SS number again and out of frustration I gave them my information in hopes of some resolution. She then confirmed that the fraudulent account had been closed, however that she wasn't sure if a physical/mailed confirmation could be mailed out to me. However that she would put in a "" request '' for physical/mailed confirmation to be sent to me but that didn't mean that I would actually receive said confirmation. 

This whole issue has been going on for months and has been a huge headache. As a bank serving the American people ( not to mention our armed forces ) I believe it's their responsibility to act quickly and justly when they're informed that they're involved with fraudulent activity. Banks have security measures to prevent this type of fraud from happening. It is clear that they either don't have these security measures or they're set up to bypass them in certain cases. They have demonstrated to me that they have no concerns for the public or their consumers, this is shown by the lack of clear answers and also inability to fulfill a request made by someone affected by their lack of security measures. 

I'm not sure if this complaint is addressed to the correct governmental organization. However I do believe that USAA lack basic consumer protections that put me in this situation and I'm sure plenty of others. As a financial institution they should have solid consumer protections and security measures in place to minimize the risk of this happening.

20750,2019-11-06,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"PLEASE READ IN ENTIRETY On XX/XX/2019, Citibank canceled my credit card accounts without any prior warning. When I called Citibank Customer Service to inquiry why, they will not tell me why they canceled my credit card accounts. The Customer Service Representative stated that the bank closed the credit card accounts. When I asked Customer Service Citibank to reopen the accounts, they refused. Also, Citibank Customer Service refused to give me the phone number of the Citibank Executive Office. I then asked Citibank Customer Service for my rewards points and rewards coupon and they refused stating that they were forfeited when the account was closed. I said that I did not close the account, Citibank did. Citibank Customer Service stated that it did not matter. I stated that they can not cease my rewards points and I will be filing a complaint with Visa, Costco, the CFPB and CA Attorney General. Citibank Customer Service did not care. 

On XX/XX/2019, I received a letter from Citibank stating that my accounts were closed because I misled them on one or more disputes. I immediately called Citibank Customer Service and asked to speak with a Manager in order to discuss this matter with them. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX and wanted to try and see if we can get this situation resolved before I take any action with Visa, Costco, the CFPB and CA Attorney General. Citibank Customer Service did not care. XXXX refused to help. I informed XXXX that the statement that is in the letter is an outright lie because I did not mislead anyone on any dispute. I then stated that I deem the Citibank Account Closure Letter to be defamation of character and this letter will be shown to the proper authorities, such as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the California Attorney General, Costco and Visa. I also stated that I do not appreciate any insinuations that I've done anything wrong. I further stated that I do not appreciate my account being closed without consulting me first. I told XXXX that I have not misled anyone nor have I provided any misinformation to anyone. 

This libelist statement is a outright discrimination on the part of Citibank and I will take action against this. I then stated to XXXX that I demand that my points be returned to me in the form of a gift certificate or a check and my Costco rewards be issued to me in the form of a check payable to me. I finished the conversation by stating that if these points and rewards are not issued back to me effective immediately, I will take legal action against Citibank for discrimination, defamation of character, intentional infliction of emotional distress, theft of my reward points balances since there is actual money that is owed to me, and libel. I finished the conversation with XXXX stating I would also be filing complaints for destroying my credit history, since Citibank notified the Credit Reporting Agencies. At this point, what Citibank has done is bordering on several violations of the banking regulations. I no longer care if they reinstate the accounts. I do not want to ever deal with Citibank after this incident, but I do want the rewards dollars and monies that I earned and are owed to me in the form of my rewards ( {$120.00} in Costco Rebate Visa and XXXX Thank You Rewards Points. ) Now, as of XX/XX/2019, Citbank continues to accuse me of being less than honest with them, which is not true. I have in both honest and straightforward with Citibank. I attempted to return the merchandise to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they refuse to take it back hence why I opened the dispute. I attempted to take back the broken item to XXXX 's and they refused to take it back stating that I needed to take it up with the manufacturer. Which is why I opened the dispute. I noticed that neither one of the companies supplied any information or evidence contradicting what I said. All they showed Citibank was copies of the register receipts. That does not negate what I've been saying all along and clearly does not constitute allegations of dishonesty. Clearly, Citibank is defaming my character and credibility, which I intend to take action against. 

Also, as of XX/XX/2019, I have never been supplied with any terms and conditions agreement, as Citibank claims that they have complied with. I now ask that they please provide a SIGNED copy of the terms and conditions with my signature on it. Absent that piece of evidence, they have no legal right to withhold my earned rewards. 

Citibank has to understand that just because something is written in a document does not mean it is legal. Thus, I'm contesting the legality of their terms and conditions, even though I have never seen the term and conditions agreement. 

I plan on filing complaints with multiple agencies and the possibly seeking legal action to recover the {$120.00} plus the {$64.00} that they have illegally taken from me with no justifiable explanation other than that fact that I forfeited the rewards when they canceled my credit card. Citibank has to understand that they've never shown me any proof that the terms and conditions state this fact and they've never show me any proof that this is legal. At this time, I also reserving the right to file a civil complaint for discrimination, defamation of character and liable. 

All this can be rectified if Citbank just issues the rewards that I have earned. I guarantee that if I file a civil complaint for discrimination, defamation of character and liable, that the legal fees for Citibank will far exceed the {$120.00} and {$64.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,91307,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3430524

My university charged me the normal monthly bill and for some reason, it charged my checking and not my e-banking account. I honestly do n't even know what the difference is. I just keep money in the e-banking, because that is what gets charged when I used it at the store, online shopping or any time I swipe it. So, the charge went through and BoA without any warning or email to allow me to transfer funds stamped a {$35.00} charge on my account. 

Now that may not seem like much to you, but I am a broke college student and to me, that is 4 hours of work. I kindly tried to explain this to one of your customer service people and they replied with "" Well can you have your university write us a statement explaining the mistake? '' What?!! I do n't even know if that is possible and if it is, it would be incredibly time consuming. "" Well it would be really helpful for your case. '' I have hundreds of dollars in my e-banking that could have been simply transferred over. But that did n't matter to BoA. 

I have been a loyal customer since the day I opened my first bank account with BoA and sadly, after today, I will have to close it. I am in disbelief that your institution which is supposed to be helping young adults save and grow their money, endlessly throws fees on their accounts. Your bank steals money from people in any way it can. There is a reason why year-after-year BoA has received some of the MOST customer complaints out of any banks. That should be a wake up call or in my opinion, a slap in the face. Not only did this situation ( which has happened too many times to count ) make me really angry, but it means that I wo n't be buying groceries this week.

On XX/XX/2021 I received a closing disclosure document from Bank of America estimating my closing costs to be {$5700.00}. My origination charges were now estimated to be {$1500.00} and total loan costs were estimated to be {$2800.00}. 

On XX/XX/2021 the day before my scheduled closing date Bank of America sent me a new closing disclosure document stating that my closing costs had increased to {$9600.00}. My origination charges were estimated to be {$2800.00} and I would be required to pay XXXX in points which came out to be {$1300.00}. My Lender origination fee remained at {$1500.00}. 

I called my loan officer to ask why they had added the additional XXXX point charge and she claimed that she had mis-categorized my XXXX XXXX XXXX as a mid rise instead of a high rise  and that high rise condos need a higher rate according to their model. This was a lie, only condo buildings 6 stories or higher are considered high rises, so my condo was considered a mid-rise. I did not get any of this in writing. 

At this point Bank of America had delayed my closing date 3 times because they lost documentation that I provided multiple times. I was worried that the seller would back out if I switched lenders and delayed closing again, so I felt like I had no leverage to negotiate with Bank of America without losing my condo. 

I only recently learned that these actions taken by Bank of America might be illegal and decided that I should file a complaint.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",GA,30309,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-27,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,5818209

You received {$2000.00} cash for this buy contract for which you breached Difference of $ XXXX {$2000.00} = {$3000.00} Negitive equity recorded was {$12000.00} which should not be reported on my credit report and actually should be recored to the owner of the debt. I can not purchase debt, this would not be a legal purchase contract, and youve now since cancelled the contract. 

The XXXX XXXX in a 3rd party name ( other than myself ) was sold for a profit by your company. 

Would you now return the original vehicle ( XXXX XXXX ) involved in this purchase to its buyer which was not me? Since the XXXX XXXX was voluntarily surrendered under the understanding the Chapter XXXX agreement would be honored, we would have asked for the vehicle to be returned and hold the position it was sold prematurely and prior to the outcome of the chapter XXXX. There should be consideration of these other factors involved. 

We had every intention of using a vehicle as we are a 2 vehicle family and this brought us down to 1 vehicle.

I've never had a problem with credit card debt and have no student loans. After calling the original creditor I discovered that I shared the exact same name as the person who owed the debt, but they understood and removed me from their system. For 4 years I would receive notices randomly from different debt collection agencies. My assumption was that this debt had been sold to several other debt collectors. Whenever I called to explain they had the wrong person and address each one stopped sending notices. 

About 3 years ago my wife got a call from a Sheriff 's officer. The man with my exact same name had died and the system listed my wife 's phone number as contact. Luckily I was at the house when she received this call and the Sheriff was very apologetic for the mistake. After this the debt notices stopped. To my recollection maybe one or two more came in the mail but as soon as I called the number listed, the collector could easily XXXX the man 's name, find his obituary, and remove me from their system. 

Two weeks ago FAMS INC started sending me notices in the mail, but whenever I call to explain the situation they will not listen. They continue to send me notices and offering settlements even though I can point them to this man 's obituary. After sharing that information with them they claim there is nothing they can do. They continually send me notices and treat me as if I'm lying if I call the number listed. They've asked for my social security number and date of birth multiple times. I have never shared that because I fear they are trying to burden me with this now deceased man 's debt whom I have no relation to at all aside from sharing a very common name.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,FINANCIAL ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS INC,CA,90039,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3463820

I called a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about when they sent out these changes and a representative informed me that they would not have.

I asked if they could at least stop the fees and I would call back to pay the balance, since their payment department was closed, the representative said they would stop the fees. A week later I noticed my credit score drop by 50 points with the reason that my account with CitiCard had been closed. I was never told that they were going to stop the fee by closing my account.

The phone calls were automated calls to a cell phone without permission. The collector pushed for a payment today by using the word required when there is no requirement for me to get into an arrangement. The collector demanded a payment today, which overshadows the validation period of them sending me a letter and allowing me the opportunity to dispute the debt before demanding a payment today, and they verified my address so I know they have the correct address to send the paperwork to.

I believe that this is real money that she has sent me since the bank cleared it so easily. I could have easily kept it, but I am someone of my word so I go into the bank and withdraw {$7200.00} cash.

She pulls up the check images and sure enough this lady sent me the same check twice. ( however you can see that my signature is different, I thought I was signing two different checks ). Bank of America has just caught this duplicate check and its a whole month later! I am worried that the original check is fraud as well and that the bank just hasn't caught it yet.

We had to run after them to provide us with some training, finally they scheduled a training day in a couple of days out, in the mean time we were not able to use or even play around with the software to figure it out because we had not been given any log in or anything to even see the billing software. 

Finally we got around to the training date and we got to speak with someone, she told us a whole list of things that we would need to obtain from Medicare so we can start billing, the things we needed were mostly things we have never heard of with very unfamiliar names and terms, we started trying to get them, in the process many questions came up and whenever we needed clarification even on minor things we would have to schedule an appointment for a few days out to discuss, all the while we are continued to be billed. 

despite all of that we continued try 'an make it work, we scheduled, waited, asked, and then scheduled again waited again and asked again. remember, we are still not able to do anything with the software, let alone bill, which that is the entire purpose of the software. 

Finally we thought we got everything they told us we need, we sent it over to them, eventually they came back and told us that the packet we received from Medicare is for the incorrect region, when we asked them which one is the correct region the answer was that they don't know and we should find out our selves. 

At that point we were already tired of this, so I sent them an email asking them to stop billing us, since they are not able to provide effective training and we have so far never used the software, something which they do not deny. 

A little after that email we began receiving emails from them about more training, but we were already tired of this unheard of process, but the bills kept coming. 

Now we received a collection letter of {$1400.00} for something we were never able to use, this is completely outrages.",,"Media Collections, Inc",NY,10962,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,5786201

20831,2020-01-25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have had a mortgage with OCWEN for the past ten years. I have had multiple problems with them as they constantly lie and destroy documents. They placed lender insurance once on me charging me XXXX XXXX of dollars in unnecessary additional insurance. I was able to solve the problem once a class action was started against them. Two months ago they suddenly reported me to the credit reporting agency saying that I had missed two payments. I disputed it stating that I was current. They stated that when my loan was transferred from OCWEN to PHH the loan was two months short and that when they audited my account in XX/XX/2019after they acquired the loan. First of all my loan was never transferred to anybody, as OCWEN bought PHH and just changed their name. They are the same company and they have all the records. They sent me a written report which shows that I paid every month, but they claim that regardless of their own report I needed to produce receipts of XXXX and XX/XX/2019 ( 12 months later ) to prove I paid in those months. It looks like they have made a mistake and they refuse to acknowledge such mistake. Since their processing is done abroad in countries where acknowledging a mistake is considered a sin, I believe that somebody has made a mistake and they can not admit they are wrong. 4 years ago an OCWEN insurance processing center in XXXX refused to acknowledge that I had an escrow account with Ocwen, when all the documents proved that I had. It took me then three months to straighten the mess by involving a US based loan manager which launched an internal investigation from the US headquarters into the XXXX office. US borrowers are paying a hefty price for Ocwen 's outsourcing their record keeping to countries where there is no understanding of basic accounting and where they are unable to read documents in XXXX due to their poor knowledge of the language. 
I was able to locate the XXXX receipt from my bank statements, but I can not locate my XXXX receipt because my husband changed its bank and did not keep the paper statement as they were all online. That notwithstanding, their own statement shows that a payment was entered in XXXX and credited it accordingly. This matter came about only in the Fall after my loan was "" transferred '' to PHH.

I did not authorize Navient to put my student loans in forbearance at that time. On XX/XX/2020, I received an email from Navient stating that my loans had been placed in disaster forbearance. The email further stated that my loans would continue to accrue interest at a rate of 3.5 %. This rate is higher than my previous interest rate of 2.275 %. I called Navient on the afternoon of XX/XX/2020 to inquire : 1 ) Why my loans had been put in forbearance without my authorization, and 2 ) why my interest would go up if the loans were in forbearance. The representative and supervisor with whom I spoke apologized for  putting the loans in forbearance without my authorization. I then asked about the increase in the interest rate. They stated that the interest rate would increase because I would no longer receive certain discounts while the loans were in forbearance. The discounts are : 1 ) a 0.225 % rate reduction for payments made by automatic withdrawal from my bank account, and 2 ) a 1 % rate reduction for consolidated loans. I understand why I would not receive the discount for automatic withdrawal. But, denying the rate reduction discount for consolidated loans is predatory. If the interest on my loans only increased by 0.225 %, then they would accumulate {$1400.00} in interest over the 3-month forbearance. If the interest increased to 3.5 % as Navient says, the loans would accumulate {$2000.00} in interest. Thus, Navient would make an additional {$590.00} from my loans. At a time of national crisis, Navient is trying to profit off of the financial difficulties of hard-working citizens. Their disaster forbearance should allow lenders to continue with their previous interest rates or at the very least keep the discount for consolidated loans.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",OH,43606,,Consent provided,Web,2020-04-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3590663

The economy has entered into a recession and home values are expected to continue to drop over the next 12-24 months.

Fay Servicing did advise us that the investor is looking for {$500000.00} on the house when their own BPO shows the value at {$400000.00} and the short sale offer in place is {$370000.00} which is 94 % of the current market value. This house is a 2 bedroom house. It will need a great deal of work to bring it to a value of {$500000.00}. First off a bedroom would have to be added. The kitchen and bathroom will need to be fully renovated. The outside of the home will need new siding and updating along with the foundation issues that need to be dealt with. The few potential buyers that showed interest in the house realized that the kitchen ( 30 years old ) and bathrooms are very old, in addition to light fixtures, doors, electrical, plumbing, winows, etc. There are many unseen updates that will need to be attended too. Any buyer will not be able to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy. Total estimate of repairs is between $ XXXX {$100000.00}. The current offer is also the highest offer we have gotten and the house has been listed for several months. 
If the property was to be held after a foreclosure for 1 year the carry costs to the investor would be XXXX based off the incorrect value the investor has of {$500000.00}. In addition to this loss the repairs needed are over {$75000.00}. This fact brings the investors value down to {$320000.00}. The BPO clearly states that the fair market value is {$400000.00}. The investor value of {$500000.00} would be market value for this house if it was in normal condition with no repairs needed and it was not a short sale. After the investor was to foreclose on the property they would have to evict the owner which will take several months and then resale the house which could take a year or more in a slowing market with increased interest rates. The investor will end up with an offer lower then what we have or at the very least equal to it. After taking into consideration fees, costs and expenses over the next 12-18 months the investor will take even more of a loss then they have and we can 100 % guarantee that the net income would be less in 1-2 years from now after a foreclosure then it would be if the short sale was to close next month with the current buyer.

We have a strong buyer who can close within 45 days of short sale approval. Please over turn this decision and approve the short sale. Submit this to the investor as well.",,"Fay Servicing, LLC",NJ,07630,,Consent provided,Web,2022-10-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6076925

XXXX weeks later, on XX/XX/XXXX, BoA sent me an email saying that my claim was closed due to, and I quote, "" the transaction in question was completed using a device that is consistent with previous valid account activity '', and that [ they ] "" now consider ' [ ed ] "" this claim closed ''. I was visiting my parents in XXXX XXXX, Ca. ( while on summervacation ) when I became aware of these transactions, and it was here where I filed a police report. I contacted the fraud department again on XX/XX/2022 to tell them I wanted to dispute their investigation findings and to include the police report to my file. The following day, I went to Bank of America located here in XXXX XXXX, Ca. to seek further assistance. I spoke to a BoA employee who seemed to be helpful ; however, he just dialed the fraud department number and handed me the phone. After about 45 minutes waiting for someone to attend to my call, a fraud department representative finally answered, and she basically told me that the transactions being disputed were made through my cellphone and to a XXXX XXXX  account located in the state of Texas. I never authorized such transactions, and I never received any notifications from XXXX about those transactions either. The following day I went to the FBI department located in XXXX XXXX, Ca. to report the fraud on my account.

No further explanation was given as to why they decided to do so.

The expiration date is XXXX and on the white background above the barcode states clearly {$2.00} activation fee. I went to use it and found out it had to be registered. After submitting all information including an SSN, setting up an account, the website did not allow access to the account information. 

I called and found out that the balance was eaten up due to dormancy fees. 
They said its clearly written on the packaging. I asked where. 
And was told to look at 4 boxes, they were black background with white and blue print. They read : monthly fee- none, atm withdrawal fee {$1.00}, transaction fee- XXXX, reload fee {$3.00}. None of which was Important since I was using as a gift card. I said it doesnt say anything about dormancy fees. 
XXXX the supervisor told me it was below the boxes. I said in font size 2? Yes. She said. It is printed on dark blue background in black ink and too small for me to read even with reading glasses. 

She said its not our fault you cant read it, its written there and the money is gone. 

I see from your website there is a difference between gift cards and Reloadable debit cards. I never used any such thing, I have my own credit cards. I believe these cards are just legal means to rob people by their use of fees. The time of inactivity should begin when you activate the card not when the person purchases it. They offered no solace, no restoration of my {$50.00} gift and said thats the way it is. 

They need to CLEARLY show there are dormancy fees on a white background with black ink that is in a font people can read. Arent there ADA requirements for information that is  detrimental to the individual? 

Banks are charging ludicrous fees every time you turn around and this card just highlights the abuse to people with no credit who need to use this type of vehicle. The bank sucks these poor peoples money through every legal fee in the book. For me it was the loss of a {$50.00} gift card.

Because of this, my escrow account was in the negative - {$350.00}. The insurance rejected this payment from this company and the company paid it again. The dates they ran the payment to insurance was : XX/XX/XXXX {$1000.00} They paid insurance on this date XXXX $ XXXX insurance kicked back this payment XX/XX/XXXX {$1000.00} They paid this again I cashed my escrow refund due to the agent who I spoke to telling me that it was okay to do so.

I contacted the company on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX. He said the company made a mistake during the escrow analysis update and never should have sent out a refund check. He stated he was putting in a work order to have this fixed and that my payment should remain XXXX. He told me the company would contact me.

They make it a business to rip off their customers. First, I am a on time payment customer. Just this month I receive a bill telling me that my loans are in deferment. This is obviously not the case as I have been making full principal and interest payments for the past year. Also I have graduated college in XXXX, so this makes no sense. Tell me how my loans get to be placed in deferment with out my authorization???? They do n't. What they are doing if fraudulent and unfair. Had I not noticed this, 1 ) One of my loans I would be paying interest only and NEVER paying principal. According to the contract I signed this would not be the case because as stated from years XXXX to XXXX I am on a full principal & interest payment plan. This lines their pockets with cash and me the consumer does not get out of debt. Talk about unfair business practices. 
2 ) My second loan is in a worse situation. According to them the loan is in "" In School Fixed Payment Plan '' which is a euphemism for NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION. Tell me again how this happened?? I go from full principal and interest payments to a Negative Amortization plan. The problem with this is that the interest that accrues over the billing cycle does NOT get paid and gets added back to the principal. This increases your principal balance so you NEVER get out of the loan. I have about {$27000.00} in outstanding principal balance. {$250.00} in Interest is being added back to my principal balance. How does this happen when my payment plan is in FULL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS.

They called from the USAA customer service number and texted me verification codes from the USAA automated text number and emailed me official USAA documents saying that someone was trying to steal money from me. They moved {$3400.00} from my savings account into my checking account, then wired out everything but the {$20.00} for the wire fee. I reported the event on XX/XX/XXXX when I realized what had happened. The USAA banker I spoke to on the 14th filed a financial crime report and took no further actions. 

I called back on the 15th asking for clarification on what I should do and what I should expect the bank to do. At this time, I was told that I was supposed have been transferred to the security team the first time I called but was not offered an explanation for why this didn't happen. Another financial crime report was filed at this time. I then spoke to the wire transfer department who tried to recall the wire transfer, and the security team who had me change my account log in information and security questions. The security team member said that was all that I needed to do ( in addition to using a credit monitoring service ) and that I did not need to make a new account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from the fraud department at USAA informing me that the case was investigated and the decision was made that I was explicitly not found liable and would be reimbursed in full. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, {$3400.00} were transferred into my savings account. This was the amount that was stolen out of my savings account, but I was not reimbursed for the XXXX that was stolen from my checking account and I was not given any reason for this. I received a {$1400.00} tax refund on XX/XX/XXXX as a XXXX transfer, but I don't see any reason why a USAA agent would mistake that for a credit from the bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a fraudulent check marked # XXXX took {$3400.00} out of my checking account. For some reason USAA allowed this check to be processed, leaving my account at a liability of about - {$2000.00}. 

I called USAA customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and explained what happened and was inexplicably transferred to a debt-collector. The debt-collector said that I owed the {$2000.00} because the bank had really only given me a provisional credit and then took it back out of my account because I was found liable. I explained that this didn't make any sense because the person who spoke to me said the opposite, it was taken out by a fake check, and I was left with a negative balance. I was then transferred to a banker who listened to me and actually looked at my account history in order to make detailed notes about what happened. He said that they should have had me close the compromised account in the first place, and I never should have been transferred to a debt-collector. He advised that I open a new account now and wait for the fraudulent check to come back before I transfer all my money into new accounts. I opened a new account that day and have been waiting to get my money back since then. 

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and someone who was able to see the fraud department 's notes said that I would be reimbursed in full within XXXX days, including the money that I was owed from the first instance of fraud. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX because I still had not received any money and was told that no one can see the fraud department 's notes but the banker wrote a message for the fraud department that I had called asking about the case.

Attempts to go through that process simply do n't work. They required me to upload scans of my driver 's license. But their website was issuing error codes like "" Constraints can not be met '', which reps at Coinbase could n't explain.

I am very disappointed at how American Express handling this case. There is no place in the email stating that I should not apply through CSR chat.

Hello, I am faxing these materials to you to dispute what is on my credit report. I applied for a credit card from HSBC in XX/XX/2018. They approved my request immediately and sent me the card in the mail promptly. I was going to use it for the holidays. 

Thats when the trouble started. I set up the online access, installed the app on my phone and found that I couldnt use the card because there was some sort of hold that required me to speak to security. I started calling to speak to security and couldnt get through after being on hold for more than an hour. I repeated. And repeated. And repeated. I spoke to the chat person multiple times asking for numbers to get through to security. The hold times extended to multiple hours and went on day after day. 

I started calling on my one hour commute to work and kept myself on hold the entire time, then I brought my phone charger to work and stayed on hold for at least 3-4 hours and kept my phone plugged in. I carefully tracked the security open and closed hours and tried to call right at opening or right before closing. Nothing. Always on hold.

I was probably on hold for more than 50 hours before I gave up. This went on for at least two weeks. I looked up new numbers on the Internet. I begged the customer service people in the other departments to connect me to security. No matter how I tried to get to security I ended up in the black hole of background hold music. My hopes to use this card for the holidays disappeared.

Then, I got annoyed. It occurred to me that even if I could actually use this card, if it were stolen or lost, I could never reach security. I looked up consumer reviews for your customer service and found they were dismal. I was not alone. This was happening to scores of people. I decided I didnt want this annoyance in my life. I called a customer service person and requested that they cancel my card. That took a while but it was eventually accomplished. The account is closed.

I am calling because the process of applying for your credit card caused an inquiry on my credit report. And now there is a new account listed as well, albeit closed. This is absolutely unreasonable and improper when you advertise a card that someone applies for and then you make it impossible for them to use the card.

I did everything I was supposed to do. I allowed the credit inquiry assuming I would have something to show for it. All I had to show for it was aggravation. No ability to use a credit card. I never got through to security to unblock my card. I have no idea why it was blocked from the start regardless. My credit is excellent. There are no issues.

I request that you contact the credit agencies and that the credit inquiry and the HSBC account be deleted from my credit reports. I made a dispute with Equifax, they referred me back to you. I called the number they supplied on their response and that person referred me to a supervisor in the customer service area. I spoke to her and she referred me to your department and asked me to fax this information. 

HSBC Account : I was approved by letter on XX/XX/2018. I received a letter affirming the account was closed on XX/XX/2018. 

If you would like me to supply my cell phone logs to support how many times I called your organization, I am happy to do that. If you would like copies of multiple review sites about credit cards that state that this is a well-known issue affecting many people, I am happy to send copies of those as well. 

Please get the credit inquiry and any evidence of your account off my credit reports.

I am seeking to terminate the Renovation loan and have the loan balance applied to the principal balance of my mortgage and the company refuses to terminate the loan. Originally held by XXXX XXXX, the mortgage or renovation loan portion of the mortgage is currently administered by HomeBridge Financial Services.
HomeBridge had indicated that if I did not re-apply for an extension of the loan, the loan would be terminated. I did not apply for an extension, but they did not terminate the loan. 

I contacted HomeBridge and demanded the termination of the loan. HomeBridge has refused to terminate the loan. 

HomeBridge demanded an appraisal of the property, which I consented to, and an appraisal was conducted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have made numerous, almost daily, requests for a copy of the appraisal, and have always been told by several individuals at HomeBridge that they do n't have a copy of the appraisal and have never received a copy of the appraisal. I contacted the company that conducted the appraisal and they related the following : the appraisal was tendered to HomeBridge on XX/XX/XXXX ;  on XX/XX/XXXX, HomeBridge requested modifications to the appraisal ; on XX/XX/XXXX, a modified appraisal was tendered to HomeBridge. The appraisal company had also sent copies of the appraisal to a company called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Representatives of XXXX XXXX informed me that they too sent a copy of the appriasal to HomeBridge on XX/XX/XXXX. The last time I contacted HomeBridge demanding a copy of the appraisal was XX/XX/XXXX. The HomeBridge representative at that time told me that HomeBridge never received a copy of the appraisal. 

I have requested the termination of my renovation loan, HomeBridge refuses. 
I have requested a copy of the original appraisal conducted on my property, HomeBridge has actively misrepresented to me that they never received an appraisal when in fact they received several copies of the appriasal and requested modifications to same ; I have requested a copy of the modified appraisal conducted on my property, again HomeBridge consistently states they never received a copy ; HomeBridge fails and refuses to respond to requests for information ; HomeBridge fails and refuses to produce information regarding my loan ; HomeBridge representatives have consistently given me divergent and conflicting information regarding my loan and the process for the termination of my loan.

I had no idea that income-based repayment plans were available. Had I known, I would have immediately entered one upon graduating. But that was n't the case.

Furthermore, on XX/XX/XXXX they Capitalized Interest in the amount of {$25000.00}. I had already submitted my IBR renewal and they confirmed they received it and it would be processed on time. 

Sallie Mae/Navient used a preposterous amount of phone calls to continually pressure me into repaying my loan without an income, placed me into forbearance without giving me the option of joining an income-based repayment plan, and capitalized interest on my loan several times for no reason.
